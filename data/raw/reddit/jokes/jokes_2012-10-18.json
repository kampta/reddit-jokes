I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Really?&quot; asked the hairdresser. &quot;What&#39;d he say?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He said, &quot;Where did you get that shitty hairdo?&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "A woman was at her hairdresser's getting her hair styled prior to a  trip to Rome with her boyfriend. She mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, who responded, \"Rome? Why would anyone want to go to Rome? It's crowded and dirty and, worse yet, full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. \nSo, how are you getting there?\" \"We're flying on US Air,\" was the reply. \"We got a great rate!\"  \"US Air?\" exclaimed the hairdresser. \"That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their light attendants are ugly and they're always late.\n \nSo, where are you staying in Rome?\" \"We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's left side called Teste.....\"\"Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks it\u2019s gonna be something special and exclusive. But it's really a dump, the worst hotel in the whole city! The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're way overpriced. \n\nSo, whatcha doing  when you get there?\" \"We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.\" \"That's rich,\" laughed the hairdresser. \"You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're sure going to need it.\"\n\n A month later, the woman, all smiling, came in for her hair appointment. The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome. \"It was absolutely wonderful,\" explained the woman, \"not only did we arrive on time in one of US Air's brand new jets, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28 year old steward who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel ... it was fabulous! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's just a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!\"\n \n\"Well,\" muttered the hairdresser, \"I know you didn't get to see the Pope.\" \"Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later, the Holy Father walked through the door. I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me.\"\n\n\"Really?\" asked the hairdresser. \"What'd he say?\"\n\n He said, \"Where did you get that shitty hairdo?\"\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "We all know someone like this", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_11o4q3", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/11o4q3/we_all_know_someone_like_this/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "11o4q3", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "b1956b", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 175, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1350569258.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/11o4q3/we_all_know_someone_like_this/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1350558621.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/11o4q3/we_all_know_someone_like_this/", "created_utc": 1350529821.0, "ups": 175, "num_comments": 5}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The bar tender notices that he has a ships wheel sticking out of the front of his pants, he asks &quot;doesn&#39;t that bother you&quot;.
