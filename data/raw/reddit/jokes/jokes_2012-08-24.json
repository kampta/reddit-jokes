Down, down through the chambers he went, marching tirelessly in exciting anticipation of his groundbreaking archaeological discovery. There was nothing that could deter him now! Well, maybe one thing: He remembered hearing a story while in town about the ghost that supposedly guarded the ancient king, but he decided to put it out of his mind and continue his venture down into the timeworn crypt.</p>\n\n<p>Time passed.</p>\n\n<p>As he finally neared the burying chamber, he suddenly heard a deep moaning coming from somewhere. It was too dark to see exactly where. And, sure enough, it was the ghost of the Pharaoh&#39;s guard was now standing before him. The ghost appeared relatively nonthreatening, his ethereal spear notwithstanding. In a mix of curiosity and a desire to not be spirit-stabbed, the man attempted to strike up a conversation. To his surprise and good fortune, the phantom, as it turned out, was actually quite civil. With the lingering fear of impalement-by-apparition still looming over his head, the man thought to get the guard talking as long as possible.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So... How did you end up as a ghost?&quot; the man asked.</p>\n\n<p>The guard replied thusly, &quot;Years and years ago while I was still of the living, I had been wandering  throughout all the lands in search of adventures. Ah, those were good times. You remind me a bit of myself, with your wild youth and reckless abandon. But I digress. One day I was passing through the local town when I happened to bump to the royal court magician in the market place.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man remembered the town. It was the very same where he first learned of the spectral sentinel.</p>\n\n<p>The ghost continued, &quot;I had overheard him telling a merchant about some sort of &#39;immortality&#39; spell he had recently devised. He said he needed someone to practice it on, so I jumped in and offered my services to him as a test subject. Apparently, I was just the type of subject he&#39;d been looking for, so he agreed.</p>\n\n<p>What the ritual for the spell required, this magician said, was the blood of the Pharaoh. Something about being a &#39;descendant of the gods&#39; or something like that. To perform the rite, I was to spill his blood in the Red Sea, killing him upon the 3rd time. The magician was able to procure enough of his blood for two visits, after which I accompanied the Pharaoh there on &#39;official business.&#39; </p>\n\n<p>I pointed out to the sea. &#39;Hey, what&#39;s that?&#39; I said, knowing full well that there was nothing out there. He was distracted. I slit his neck.</p>\n\n<p>After killing him and performing the final part of the ritual, I blacked out. When I awoke, I was in this tomb like this, unable to leave. The spell must have gone wrong somehow, for I am now forever cursed in the afterlife to protect the king from grave robbers.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man had zoned out partway through his tedious and unnecessarily verbose explanation, &quot;What? Can you just give me the short version?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The guard said, &quot;I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took a Pharaoh to the Sea.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "After many long weeks of endless searching in the desert, the man finally found the ancient Pharaoh's tomb he had for so long been seeking. \n\nHe descended. Down, down through the chambers he went, marching tirelessly in exciting anticipation of his groundbreaking archaeological discovery. There was nothing that could deter him now! Well, maybe one thing: He remembered hearing a story while in town about the ghost that supposedly guarded the ancient king, but he decided to put it out of his mind and continue his venture down into the timeworn crypt.\n\nTime passed.\n\nAs he finally neared the burying chamber, he suddenly heard a deep moaning coming from somewhere. It was too dark to see exactly where. And, sure enough, it was the ghost of the Pharaoh's guard was now standing before him. The ghost appeared relatively nonthreatening, his ethereal spear notwithstanding. In a mix of curiosity and a desire to not be spirit-stabbed, the man attempted to strike up a conversation. To his surprise and good fortune, the phantom, as it turned out, was actually quite civil. With the lingering fear of impalement-by-apparition still looming over his head, the man thought to get the guard talking as long as possible.\n\n\"So... How did you end up as a ghost?\" the man asked.\n\nThe guard replied thusly, \"Years and years ago while I was still of the living, I had been wandering  throughout all the lands in search of adventures. Ah, those were good times. You remind me a bit of myself, with your wild youth and reckless abandon. But I digress. One day I was passing through the local town when I happened to bump to the royal court magician in the market place.\"\n\nThe man remembered the town. It was the very same where he first learned of the spectral sentinel.\n\n\n The ghost continued, \"I had overheard him telling a merchant about some sort of 'immortality' spell he had recently devised. He said he needed someone to practice it on, so I jumped in and offered my services to him as a test subject. Apparently, I was just the type of subject he'd been looking for, so he agreed.\n\nWhat the ritual for the spell required, this magician said, was the blood of the Pharaoh. Something about being a 'descendant of the gods' or something like that. To perform the rite, I was to spill his blood in the Red Sea, killing him upon the 3rd time. The magician was able to procure enough of his blood for two visits, after which I accompanied the Pharaoh there on 'official business.' \n\nI pointed out to the sea. 'Hey, what's that?' I said, knowing full well that there was nothing out there. He was distracted. I slit his neck.\n\n\nAfter killing him and performing the final part of the ritual, I blacked out. When I awoke, I was in this tomb like this, unable to leave. The spell must have gone wrong somehow, for I am now forever cursed in the afterlife to protect the king from grave robbers.\"\n\nThe man had zoned out partway through his tedious and unnecessarily verbose explanation, \"What? Can you just give me the short version?\"\n\nThe guard said, \"I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took a Pharaoh to the Sea.\"\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A man sets off for adventure in Egypt to search for an an ancient tomb.
