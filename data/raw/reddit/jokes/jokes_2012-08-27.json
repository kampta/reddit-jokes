I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me.

I simply watched as she walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible  that all she could do before gathering her senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving her\narms about her head as  though trying to ward off angry bees.  This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh.\nMistake.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing.  When you laugh, it&#39;s hard to keep things &#39;clamped down&#39;, if you know what I mean.  With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region.  Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly things were no longer funny.  IT was coming,\nand I raced off through the store towards the restrooms, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I&#39;d make it before the grandmal assplosion took place.</p>\n\n<p>Luck was on my side.  Just in the nick of time I got\nto the john, began the inevitable &#39;Oh my God&#39;, floating above the toilet seatbecause my ass is burning SO BAD, purging.  One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of &#39;Shock and Awe&#39;.  He made a gagging sound,  and disgustedly said, &#39;Sonofabitch! &#39;, then quickly left.</p>\n\n<p>Once finished I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store\nemployee approached me and said,&#39;Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes.It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store.The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>That of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt\nup to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, &#39;IT&#39;S YOU!&#39;, then ran off returning moments later with the manager.  I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.</p>\n\n<p>Home again without having shopped, I realized that\nthere was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls.

In  a mad rush for freedom they  bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the restrooms which would bring sweetrelief, it happened.\nThe peppers fired a warning shot.\n\nThere I stood, alone in the spice and baking aisle,suddenly enveloped in a  noxious cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded.  I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me.  Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed\nto leave the lower part of my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as an elderly woman turned into it.\n\nI don't know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what her reaction would be to the invisible but odorous cloud that\nrefused to dissipate, as she walked into it unsuspecting.  \nHave you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally?  Here's whatI mean, and I'm sure some of you at least will be able  to relate.\n\nI could've warned that poor woman but didn't.  I simply watched as she walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible  that all she could do before gathering her senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving her\narms about her head as  though trying to ward off angry bees.  This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh.\nMistake.\n\nHere's the thing.  When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean.  With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region.  Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.\n\nSuddenly things were no longer funny.  IT was coming,\nand I raced off through the store towards the restrooms, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grandmal assplosion took place.\n\nLuck was on my side.  Just in the nick of time I got\nto the john, began the inevitable 'Oh my God', floating above the toilet seatbecause my ass is burning SO BAD, purging.  One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'.  He made a gagging sound,  and disgustedly said, 'Sonofabitch! ', then quickly left.\n\nOnce finished I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store\nemployee approached me and said,'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes.It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store.The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.'\n\nThat of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt\nup to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager.  I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return.\n\nHome again without having shopped, I realized that\nthere was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Kroger's.  I can't say\nanymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. Bastards claim they're going to have to repaint the store\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false,
