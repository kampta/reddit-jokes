Does it get stuffy? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Do you want a computer with Windows? </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I don&#39;t know. What do I see when I look out the windows? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Wallpaper. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software. </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Software that runs on Windows? </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: No, on the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals, track expenses. You know, run a business. What have you got? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Office. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: I just did. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: You just did what? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Recommended something. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: You recommended something? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Yes. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: For my office? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Yes. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Okay, what did you recommend for my office? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Office. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Yes, for my office. </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Office for Windows. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I already have an office and it already has windows! Let&#39;s say I&#39;m sitting at my computer, and I want to type a proposal. What do I need? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Word. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: If I&#39;m writing a proposal, I&#39;m going to need lots of words. But what program do I load? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Word. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: What word? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: The Word in Office. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: The only word in office is office. </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: The Word in Office for Windows. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Which word in &quot;office for windows?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: The Word you get when you click the blue W. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I&#39;m going to click your big W if you don&#39;t give me a straight answer. Let&#39;s forget about words for a minute. What do I need if I want to watch a movie over the Internet? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: RealOne. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Maybe a real movie, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. But what do I need to watch it? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: RealOne. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: If it&#39;s a long movie I&#39;ll also want to watch reels two, three and four. Can I watch reel four? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Of course. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Great! With what? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: RealOne. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Okay, so I&#39;m sitting at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: You click the blue 1. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I click the blue one what? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: The blue 1. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue W? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Of course it is. The blue 1 is Real One. The blue W is Word. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: What word? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: The Word in Office for Windows. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: But there&#39;s three words in &quot;office for windows!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: No, just one. But it&#39;s the most popular Word in the world. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: It is? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Yes, although to be fair there aren&#39;t many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: And that word is the real one? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: No. Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn&#39;t even part of Office. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Never mind; I don&#39;t want to get started with that again. But I also need something for bank accounts, loans, and so on. What do you have to help me track my money? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Money. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: That&#39;s right. What do you have? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Money. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I need money to track my money? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: No, not really. It comes bundled with your computer. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: What comes bundled with my computer? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Money. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Money comes bundled with my computer? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Exactly. No extra charge. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer at no extra charge? How much money do I get? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Just one copy. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I get a copy of money. Isn&#39;t that illegal? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: No. We have a license from Microsoft to make copies of Money. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Microsoft can license you to make money? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Why not? They own it. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Well, it&#39;s great that I&#39;m going to get free money, but I&#39;ll still need to track it. Do you have anything for managing your money? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Managing Your Money? That program disappeared years ago. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Well, what do you sell in its place? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Money. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: You sell money? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Of course. But if you buy a computer from us, you get it for free. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: That&#39;s all very wonderful, but I&#39;ll be running a business. Do you have any software for, you know, accounting? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Simply Accounting. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Probably, but it might get a little complicated. </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: If you don&#39;t want Simply Accounting, you might try M.Y.O.B. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: M.Y.O.B.? What does that stand for? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Mind Your Own Business. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I beg your pardon? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: No, that would be I.B.Y.P. I said M.Y.O.B. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Look, I just need to do some accounting for my home business. You know--accounting? You do it with money. </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Of course you can do accounting with Money. But you may need more. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: More money? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: More than Money. Money can&#39;t do everything. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: I don&#39;t need a sermon! Okay, let&#39;s forget about money for the moment. I&#39;m worried that my computer might... what&#39;s the word? Crash. And if my computer crashes, what can I use to restore my data? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Go Back. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: Okay. I&#39;m worried about my computer smashing and I need something to restore my data. What do you recommend? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: Go Back. </p>\n\n<p>COSTELLO: How many times do I have to repeat myself? </p>\n\n<p>ABBOT: I&#39;ve never asked you to repeat yourself.

It's a good all around combination and it's on sale this week for only $20.00.\"\n\nShe says \"It's amazing you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I'll take it!\" As she open her purse her credit card falls on the floor.\n\n\"Oh that sounds like a Master Card\" he says. \n\nShe bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts. At first she is embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way for the blind clerk to know she was the one who farted. Being blind he wouldn't know she was the only one around.  \n\nThe man ring up the fishing rod and says \"That'll be $34.50 please.\" The woman is totally confused by this and asks \"Didn't you tell me the rod and reel were on sale for $20.00? How did you get $34.50?\"\n\nHe replies \"Yes ma'am, the rod and reel are $20.00.
