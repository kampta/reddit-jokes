Tell this barkeep what keeps this bar dry during rainy days\" \"Ruff!\" the dog says. The bartender, now frustrated, says \"Ok Pal, Where's my $3.50?\" The man waves him off and explains that Scruffy is merely jesting and orders another shot, which the bartender pours and watches the shot disappear. \"Ok Scruffy, who is the greatest baseball player that has ever played the game?\" \"Ruff!\" The dog replies with a wagging tail. The bartender now gets fed up with the man and his \"talking\" dog and throws them to the street. The man gets up, wipes his face and looks to Scruffy. Scruffy looks up and says \"Well, I guess I should have said Joe DiMaggio\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "My boss has some winners, but I always get a chuckle from this one.
