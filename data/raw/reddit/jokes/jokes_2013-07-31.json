The next day, there's a knock on the door and there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic, 19 year old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of Nike running shoes and a sign round her neck. She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, \"If you can catch me, you can have me.\" \n\nWithout a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later, huffing and puffing, he finally catches her and has his way with her. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 10 lb. as promised. He then calls the company and orders their 5-day, 20 lb. program. \n\nThe next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, \"If you can catch me you can have me.\" \n\nWell, he's out the door after her like a shot! This girl is in excellent shape and it takes him quite a while to catch her but when he does, it's definitely worth every muscle cramp and wheeze. So for the next four days the same routine happens.

The gorilla loses its balance and plummets to the forest floor, where the dog bites it in the balls. The American man and the Great White Hunter throw the net over the gorilla, and it's captured.\n\nOnce again, the man realizes, the Pygmy with a gun didn't do shit!\n\nThe next morning, the man, angry that he's paying so much extra money for a useless team mate, approaches the Great White Hunter. \"Hey,\" he says, \"I've been watching, and the Pygmy with a gun doesn't do shit! What gives? I'm not going to pay for him!\"\n\nThe Great White Hunter calmly replies, \"I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. He's an essential part of the team, always will be. You pay for the Pygmy, or we don't hunt.\"\n\nThe man begrudgingly accepts the Great White Hunter's ultimatum.\n\nThe man, the Great White Hunter, the Watusi, the dog, and the Pygmy with a gun all go out hunting again. It's not long before the Great White Hunter tracks down a gorilla, an especially big one, who begins jumping up and down, jumping up and down in his tree. The Great White Hunter shouts to the Watusi, who climbs the tree, climbs out on the gorilla's branch, and begins jumping up and down, jumping up and down on the branch with the gorilla. After about thirty seconds, however, the Watusi begins to lose his balance. He slips and falls! As the Watusi is plummeting to the forest floor, he cries out:\n\"Shoot the dog!
