Sarkozy gettin' cozy ;)\".\n\nHave to bring this up, Burger King has debuted a new hands-free Whopper eating device. Burger King says the device is perfect for the multi-tasker looking to enjoy his Whopper while typing out a will before it forms that pesky arterial clot.\n\nThis is ridiculous, a Maryland boy was suspended for chewing his Pop Tart into the shape of a gun - and also for making threats against the rival pastry gang, \"The Betty Glockers\".\n\nAnother entertainment story, Amazon.com is set to create its own political TV series.

I\u2019m not shallow, but since I spent most of my twenties picking men up because I didn\u2019t want my hair to frizz in their non-air conditioned jalopies on 3 wheels and a 15 year old spare, I welcomed his fancy sports car with open arms.\nWe arrived at the restaurant and Rob was ordering food I hadn\u2019t allowed myself to eat in years.

There was nothing I could do. As impressive as I am with sphincter control, this was out of my hands. Slowly, it eeked out. The more I tried to stop it, the more it forced its way through the door. However, to my pleasant surprise, there was no sound. I sat silently, sweat accumulating above my upper lip. Ok, maybe I got away with it. Maybe I\u2019m home free. Then it hit me. Not an idea, a cloud. A horrific, fart cloud. Not in a, \u201cam I smelling something?\u201d sort of way.

Water started to accumulate at the base of his eyelids, \u201cOh my God, I CAN TASTE IT!\u201d he screamed.\n\u201cRoll down the windows!\u201d As I screamed, the toots started to flood out uncontrollably. I scratched and clawed at the window like I was being kidnapped. Rob, unable to see either by fart cloud or panic, kept turning on the windshield wipers instead of unlocking the window.\nIt was chaos. We were acting like we were under siege by gun fire. We were under siege alright, just not by gun fire.\nFinally he was able to hit the right control and he rolled down our windows. We both gulped in fresh air. I was horrified, yet happy to be alive, then remembered I just farted on the man of dreams, then sorta wished I was dead.\nWe sat silently for the rest of the way home. Although the shooting pains had subsided, I now desperately needed to use the bathroom, in an urgent, explosive kind of way.\nHe pulled up to my apartment and before he could come to a stop I had already jumped out, \u201cOk, thanks for dinner, sorry about the fart, love the shoes!\u201d and ran in to my apartment like I was running from the cops.\nI burst through my door and ran straight for the bathroom, where I was finally able to unleash and make noises that no one should ever, EVER, hear coming from another person.\nThen I heard it.
