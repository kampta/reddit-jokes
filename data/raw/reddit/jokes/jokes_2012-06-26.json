So off he goes to high school, with nothing but his knowledge and the wings on his back. He gets to high school and starts passing all of his classes with flying colors. We&#39;re talking A&#39;s in every class, and on top of that, he was also very popular <em>and</em> he was a huge jock, which caused almost everyone in the school to like him. He had a ton of girlfriends, won almost every award the school had to offer, and graduated a year early as valedictorian.</p>\n\n<p>After his little stint in high school, the wasp decided that it would be a great idea to go to college. So he applies for a few prestigious colleges, and gets accepted into all of them. The wasp is honored, but there is really only one college he wants to go to- Harvard. So here is this wasp, flying his smug little waspy ass into a Harvard classroom, flooring all professors and students with his knowledge of just about everything. Once again, he is an all-star athlete, straight-A student, and a very popular &quot;person&quot; to be around. He graduates Harvard Law, and decides to start up his own law firm.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, people are starting to recognize this wasp around the entire state. He is winning legal cases left and right, and making sure to only take the non-shady deals. He has enough money to pay off all of his debt, buy a house, and own several properties apart from his main residence. He stays a lawyer for over ten years before thinking to himself, &quot;I could do a lot more for this country...&quot;, and decides to run for Governor. Now people from out-of-state are recognizing the name of this wasp, and he is gaining support quickly. Election day comes and he wins in a landslide victory, with his opponents willingly handing the title to the brilliant little fella. The wasp serves his terms as Governor, cleaning up the state as a whole, and influencing many other states around the nation to take place in a nation-wide reform. </p>\n\n<p>It is at this point that the wasp starts to long for home, for the simplicity of the colony, and for the bonds of family.

All of his friends and family tell him how proud they are of him, and invite him to stay as long as he wants. </p>\n\n<p>The wasp is relaxing in the colony, when he starts to think to himself, &quot;Wow, I&#39;m getting wicked thirsty... I might as well hit up the old watering hole!&quot;. So he trucks his way down to the watering hole, where he finds a HUGE line of other insects. It&#39;s at that point that he remembers that his colony is almost famous for its unbearably long lines for water. He waits in line for almost an hour before saying fuck it, and getting out of line. Almost to the point of dying from thirst, the wasp has an epiphany, his colony <em>is</em> famous for its fruit punch, and because of that, the lines are normally not as long as the lines for water!

The wasp returns home and finds his entire colony waiting to greet him and welcome him back. All of his friends and family tell him how proud they are of him, and invite him to stay as long as he wants. \n\nThe wasp is relaxing in the colony, when he starts to think to himself, \"Wow, I'm getting wicked thirsty... I might as well hit up the old watering hole!\". So he trucks his way down to the watering hole, where he finds a HUGE line of other insects. It's at that point that he remembers that his colony is almost famous for its unbearably long lines for water. He waits in line for almost an hour before saying fuck it, and getting out of line. Almost to the point of dying from thirst, the wasp has an epiphany, his colony *is* famous for its fruit punch, and because of that, the lines are normally not as long as the lines for water! The little wasp flies down to the punch bowl and, whaddayaknow, \n\nThere was no punch line.
