I can also play any musical instrument.\"\n\n\"True story!\" Says Bob the sailor \"...but if you wanna test him, you've gotta pay 50 bucks a try!\"\n\nOne fella reaches into his pocket and says \"Here's $50, and my harmonica.\" Ollie plays a long, slow, mournful song that quiets the bar and brings a tear to the eye of everyone with a heart not made of stone. This is truly amazing, especially since octopi are devoid of lips.\n\nJimmy runs out to his car and grabs his fiddle. He hands it to Ollie with a crisp $50 bill.
