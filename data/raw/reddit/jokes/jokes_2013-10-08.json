Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' \n\nSuddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear \n'Get the right f***ing number!' \nAnd the phone was slammed down on me. \n\nI couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. \n\nWhen I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, \nI found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. \n\nAfter hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. \n\nWhen the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!' \nAnd hung up. \n\nI wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, \nAnd put it in my desk drawer. \n\nEvery couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, \nI'd call him up and yell, 'You're an asshole!' \n\nIt always cheered me up. \n\nWhen Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. \n\nSo, I called his number and said, 'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. \nI'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' \n\nHe yelled 'NO!' And slammed down the phone. \n\nI quickly called him back and said, 'That's because you're an asshole!' \nAnd hung up. \n\nOne day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. \n\nSome guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. \n\nI hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. \n\nI noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number. \n\nA couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (I had his number on speed dial) \nI thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too. \n\nI said, 'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?' \n\nHe said, 'Yes, it is.' \n\nI then asked, 'Can you tell me where I can see it?' \n\nHe said, 'Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd. , in Fairfax \nIt's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' \n\nI asked, 'What's your name?' \n\nHe said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' \n\nI asked, 'When's a good time to catch you, Don?' \n\nHe said, 'I'm home every evening after five.' \n\nI said, 'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?' \n\nHe said, 'Yes?' \n\nI said, 'Don, you're an asshole!' \n\nThen I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. \n\nNow, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. \n\nThen I came up with an idea... \n\nI called asshole #1. \n\nHe said, 'Hello' \n\nI said, 'You're an asshole!' \n(But I didn't hang up.) \n\nHe asked, 'Are you still there?' \n\nI said, 'Yeah!' \n\nHe screamed, 'Stop calling me' \n\nI said, 'Make me.' \n\nHe asked, 'Who are you?' \n\nI said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' \n\nHe said, 'Yeah? Where do you live?' \n\nI said, 'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, a yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.' \n\nHe said, 'I'm coming over right now, Don. \nAnd you had better start saying your prayers.' \n\nI said, 'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' and hung up. \n\nThen I called Asshole #2. \n\nHe said, 'Hello?' \n\nI said, 'Hello, asshole,' \n\nHe yelled, 'If I ever find out who you are...' \n\nI said, 'You'll what?' \n\nHe exclaimed, 'I'll kick your ass' \n\nI answered, 'Well, asshole, here's your chance. \nI'm coming over right now.' \n\nThen I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover. \n\nThen I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax .\nI quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax . \n\nI got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop
