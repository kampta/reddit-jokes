But a terrible cow-afflicting disease swept throughout the town, and hit this families bovine particularly hard (some believed it to be sabotage, that the disease was introduced by Alpenrose to eliminate all competition. But that's neither here nor there.)\n\nThe farmer had been left with nothing but a single, pathetic old cow. His family was struggling, and making money in any form was a thing of the past. In fact, his sons more or less lived off milk and the hot-pockets they stole from their friends freezers.\n\nOne midsummer's evening, the farmer was feeling particularly good about himself.
