The girl's mother informs her that her vagina is a Garage.\n\nSo the next day they play in the sandbox again, and when the girl comes home her parents ask: \"Why are your hands covered in blood?\"\n\nShe replies with: \"The boy next door tried to drive his Racecar into my Garage, but it wouldn't fit so I ripped the back wheels off.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Why are your hands covered in blood?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_x6i8w", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/x6i8w/why_are_your_hands_covered_in_blood/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "x6i8w", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mikalshorti", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/x6i8w/why_are_your_hands_covered_in_blood/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1343319047.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/x6i8w/why_are_your_hands_covered_in_blood/", "created_utc": 1343290247.0, "ups": 12, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Grow a penis</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Grow a penis", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "How can a woman avoid cleaning, cooking and oral sex for the rest of her life?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_x5tqx", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/x5tqx/how_can_a_woman_avoid_cleaning_cooking_and_oral/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "x5tqx", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "qwertylad", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/x5tqx/how_can_a_woman_avoid_cleaning_cooking_and_oral/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1343290655.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/x5tqx/how_can_a_woman_avoid_cleaning_cooking_and_oral/", "created_utc": 1343261855.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A pig fell in the mud.</p>\n\n<p>Want to hear a clean joke?
