It takes some acting, and can only be used in certain situations, but I&#39;ve had rooms of people rolling on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>This joke works best when you are in a group of people all trading jokes.  When it comes to your turn, tell the first part:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A fisherman goes out on the ocean in his boat early one morning, and brings with him a box of donuts for breakfast.  As he&#39;s fishing, one of the donuts stands up out of the box and proclaims &quot;I&#39;m a donut!  I&#39;m a donut!&quot;  The fisherman says &quot;You&#39;re a donut!  You&#39;re not supposed to talk!  Do it again and I&#39;ll throw you into the ocean!&quot;  so the donut goes back in the box.  An hour of fishing goes by, and again, the donut gets up and proclaims &quot;I&#39;m a donut!  I&#39;m a donut!&quot;  The fisherman says &quot;What the hell donut!  I already warned you once!  If you talk again I&#39;m throwing you into the ocean!&quot;  So the donut goes back into the box.  Another hour of fishing goes by, and finally the donut gets up again and proclaims &quot;I&#39;m a donut!  I&#39;m a donut!&quot;  The fisherman screams &quot;THAT&#39;S IT!!!&quot;  And throws the donut in the ocean!!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The point is that the joke doesn&#39;t make sense, but still your job is to try and sell it to the group.  Keep saying things like &quot;C&#39;mon!  Don&#39;t you get it?  He throws the donut in the ocean!!!&quot;.  Watch as your friends groan and roll their eyes at what they perceive to be a really dumb joke with no real punchline.  Patience my child...  Sweet retribution is nye...</p>\n\n<p>Let a few more jokes go around the circle, and then proclaim that you have another!  Your friends are already skeptical of your joke telling abilities, but tell them this one they&#39;ll never see coming!:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So a man decides he&#39;s going to propose to his girlfriend, so he picked a beautiful seaside dock just as the sun is rising as the romantic setting for this memorable event.  He gets down on one knee, asks her to marry him, and she says yes!  But just as he is about to slip the ring on her finger, he drops the ring, which hits the floor, rolls off of the dock, and right into the water.  He searches for hours, diving up and down to try to find the ring but to no avail.  Finally, his now fiance says &quot;I don&#39;t care about the ring so much.  I love you and that&#39;s all that matters.  We should celebrate!&quot;  So they go out to a very expensive seafood restaurant, and the woman orders the lobster, caught fresh that day.

It takes some acting, and can only be used in certain situations, but I've had rooms of people rolling on the floor.\n\nThis joke works best when you are in a group of people all trading jokes.  When it comes to your turn, tell the first part:\n\n\"A fisherman goes out on the ocean in his boat early one morning, and brings with him a box of donuts for breakfast.  As he's fishing, one of the donuts stands up out of the box and proclaims \"I'm a donut!  I'm a donut!\"  The fisherman says \"You're a donut!  You're not supposed to talk!  Do it again and I'll throw you into the ocean!\"  so the donut goes back in the box.  An hour of fishing goes by, and again, the donut gets up and proclaims \"I'm a donut!  I'm a donut!\"  The fisherman says \"What the hell donut!  I already warned you once!  If you talk again I'm throwing you into the ocean!\"  So the donut goes back into the box.  Another hour of fishing goes by, and finally the donut gets up again and proclaims \"I'm a donut!  I'm a donut!\"  The fisherman screams \"THAT'S IT!!!\"  And throws the donut in the ocean!!!!\"\n\nThe point is that the joke doesn't make sense, but still your job is to try and sell it to the group.  Keep saying things like \"C'mon!  Don't you get it?  He throws the donut in the ocean!!!\".  Watch as your friends groan and roll their eyes at what they perceive to be a really dumb joke with no real punchline.  Patience my child...  Sweet retribution is nye...\n\nLet a few more jokes go around the circle, and then proclaim that you have another!  Your friends are already skeptical of your joke telling abilities, but tell them this one they'll never see coming!:\n\n\"So a man decides he's going to propose to his girlfriend, so he picked a beautiful seaside dock just as the sun is rising as the romantic setting for this memorable event.  He gets down on one knee, asks her to marry him, and she says yes!  But just as he is about to slip the ring on her finger, he drops the ring, which hits the floor, rolls off of the dock, and right into the water.  He searches for hours, diving up and down to try to find the ring but to no avail.  Finally, his now fiance says \"I don't care about the ring so much.  I love you and that's all that matters.  We should celebrate!\"  So they go out to a very expensive seafood restaurant, and the woman orders the lobster, caught fresh that day.  She opens up the lobster, and guess what she finds inside...........?!\"\n\nAgain your friends will look at you like you're an idiot.
