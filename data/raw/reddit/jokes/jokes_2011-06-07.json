Juan makes his family follow three rules and three rules only. No drinking, no drugs and no cursing.  Juan&#39;s family was been going by these rules for a long time and his family is completely perfect.  So one day Juan is out in his garden and his neighbor stops him.  He says &quot; Hey Juan, i noticed that your family&#39;s perfect, how is that?&quot;. So Juan invites him over and explains the three rules.  Within a week his neighbor&#39;s family is perfect and there both very happy.  Over the next month people in the town notice these two perfect family&#39;s and start asking them how they do it.  The three rules are spread around town and withing a month the entire town is perfect, and Juan is elected Mayor of the town.  So you have this one perfect town surrounded by all of these non-perfect towns, so of course people in the other towns start asking questions as to why the towns so perfect.  Well the word spreads and withing 4 months the entire state is perfect, and Juan is elected governor of the state.  So you have this one perfect state surrounded by an entire country of non-perfect states.  Of course everyone in the other states start asking questions about the perfect state and withing two years the entire country is perfect and Juan is elected as President.  SO you have this one perfect country and OF COURSE all the other country&#39;s in the world start asking questions.
