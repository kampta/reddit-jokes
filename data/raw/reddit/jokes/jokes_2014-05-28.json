Marcel thought why not challenge him to a mime off! So their agents get in touch and the even gets set. Plans are made for a major press release for the greatest mime battle in history to happen at the Saint D'ni Theatre in Montreal.\n \nThe theater sells out and the media swarms to the event. \nJean Guy walks up on the left hand of the stage. Marcel walks out on the right. \n\nJean-Guy raises his fist with the index finger extended.\nMarcel raises his fist with 2 fingers extended.\n\nJean-Guy raises a clenched fist.\nMarcel cups his hand in a ring.\n\nSuddenly Jean-Guy makes an X over his hips and thrusts towards Marcel.\nMarcel shaken loses focus and runs off the stage.\n\nThe crowd goes wild and reporters swarm after Marcel. \"Marcel, Marcel, what happened?\"\nMarcel replied. \"We walk on stage and he show me the sign for the 1st power. So I replied with the 2nd power. He said he had a grasp on the world. I said I had a grasp on reality. Then, he thrust his hip, and make an X! I don't know what the fuck! So I give up.\"\n\nWell now Jean-Guy walks off stage and the reporters swarm him. \"Jean-Guy how did you win?\"\nJean-Guy said \"I walk up and say, I stick 1 finger in your ass. He say to me I stick 2 finger in your ass. I say I stick my fist in your ass. He say it will not fit. I say I MAKE IT FIT.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Ever heard a joke about a
