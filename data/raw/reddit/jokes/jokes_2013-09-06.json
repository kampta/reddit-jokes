The drunk dude starts waving his arms in front of him like a zombie at a rave so he grabs his arms and pulls him out of the truck, and as soon as he lets go, BAM, on the floor. By this point it's like 4:30am, he wants to be done with this shit, so he yanks the guy up by the collar, pushes him against the truck so he can lock it up, and starts to drag him toward the door.\n\nThe guy's not even trying to walk by this point, he's just mumbling and giggling and belching, and the more he does it the more pissed off my friend gets. No good deed goes unpunished, the house is out in the country so the walk up to the door takes for-fucking-ever even if you're not hauling some stupid asshole drunk on bathtub vodka, and to make matters worse, every few feet he starts ranting and insisting that he can walk, and flopping around like an asshole til my friend would stand him up, let him go, then sure enough, WHAM. Face first onto the gravel. This happens a good four times before he gives up and just ignores him.\n\nThey finally reach the door, and he rings the bell. The guy's being a shithead again so he just lets his ass fall and this time he just lays there. Finally a little old lady answers the door and my friend explains where he found him, and that he's perfectly fine, just absolutely shithoused.\n\nShe thanks him profusely, then asks \"But where's his wheelchair?\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "An old mechanic friend helps a drunk.
