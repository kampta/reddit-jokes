The ants would rebuild but that douche bag elephant would keep stomping on their ant hill. After rebuilding several times only to be destroyed again, the Queen ant decided that enough was enough. The ants quickly came up with a plan to kill the elephant. They decided to hide on a tree branch extending over the anthill so that when the elephant came by they would all jump on his head at the same time. They thought that by doing so they might create enough force to knock out the elephant. Well, sure enough the elephant noticed the ant hill and went to knock it over. The ants waited for their moment and all jumped off the branch to hopefully knock out the elephant. Obviously the plan failed miserably. The elephant was enraged and used his trunk to wipe off all the ants.
