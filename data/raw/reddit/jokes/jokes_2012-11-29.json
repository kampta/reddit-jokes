The foreman points out a huge pile of sand and says to the Italian guy, \u201cYour\u2019re in charge of sweeping,\u201d to the Irishman, \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of shoveling, and to the Chinese guy, \u201cAnd you\u2019re in charge of supplies. \u201cNow, I have to leave for a little while. I expect you guys to make a dent in that pile.\u201d\n\nSo the foreman goes away for a couple hours, and when he returns, the pile of sand is untouched. He says to the Italian, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sweep any of it?\u201d The Italian replies, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a broom. You said the Chinese guy was in charge of supplies, but he disappeared and I couldn\u2019t find him.\u201d\n\nSo then the foreman turn to the Irishman and asks why he didn\u2019t shovel. The Irishman replies, \u201cI couldn\u2019t get myself a shovel. You left the Chinese guy in charge of supplies, but I couldn\u2019t find him.\u201d\n\nThe foreman is really ticked off now, and storms off toward the pile of sand looking for the Chinese guy. Just then, the Chinese guy springs out from a closet and yells: \u201cSUPPLIES!\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "An Italian, an Irishman and a Chinese fellow are hired at a construction site...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_13ydol", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13ydol/an_italian_an_irishman_and_a_chinese_fellow_are/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "13ydol", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Filipp0", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 74, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13ydol/an_italian_an_irishman_and_a_chinese_fellow_are/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1354166367.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13ydol/an_italian_an_irishman_and_a_chinese_fellow_are/", "created_utc": 1354137567.0, "ups": 74, "num_comments": 7}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>An alcoholic looked at his calendar and noticed it was almost his sons 18th birthday.
