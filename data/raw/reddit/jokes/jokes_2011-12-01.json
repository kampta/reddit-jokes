Grandpa asks 'I'll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.'\n\nThe auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.\n\nGrandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor's desk.\n\nThe auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.\n\nBut Grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.\n\n'Are you okay?' the auditor asks.\n\n'Not really,' says the attorney. 'This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here andpee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!'\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Grandpa vs The IRS.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_mwn89", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/mwn89/grandpa_vs_the_irs/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "mwn89", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "splattypus", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 48, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/mwn89/grandpa_vs_the_irs/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1322805187.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/mwn89/grandpa_vs_the_irs/", "created_utc": 1322776387.0, "ups": 48, "num_comments": 9}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>the bartender is feeling nice and offers to give him one for free. the man declines saying, </p>\n\n<p>&quot;sorry i&#39;ll blow chunks if i take that&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;oh come on, live a little&quot; says the bartender, &quot;everyone pukes once in a while&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;no, you don&#39;t understand&quot; says the man, &quot;chunks is my dog&quot; </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "the bartender is feeling nice and offers to give him one for free. the man declines saying, \n\n\"sorry i'll blow chunks if i take that\" \n\n\"oh come on, live a little\" says the bartender, \"everyone pukes once in a while\" \n\n\"no, you don't understand\" says the man, \"chunks is my dog\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "a man orders a shot at a bar...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_mwemf", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/mwemf/a_man_orders_a_shot_at_a_bar/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "mwemf", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "guschav", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/mwemf/a_man_orders_a_shot_at_a_bar/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1322793589.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/mwemf/a_man_orders_a_shot_at_a_bar/", "created_utc": 1322764789.0, "ups": 9, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/headlinejokes/comments/mweiw/michele_bachmann_vowed_to_dismantle_the_us/\">x-post from r/headlinejokes</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "[x-post from r/headlinejokes](http://www.reddit.com/r/headlinejokes/comments/mweiw/michele_bachmann_vowed_to_dismantle_the_us/)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Michele Bachmann vowed to dismantle the US embassy in Iran, which hasn't existed since the 80s.
