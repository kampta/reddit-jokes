They got him to get into the car, which was about 120 degrees, turned on the air conditioner, and cooled the car off within a few minutes. Henry got very excited and invited them back to the office, where he offered them $2 million for the patent. The brothers refused, saying they would settle for $1 million, but they wanted the recognition by having a label, \u2018The Katz Air-Conditioner,\u2019 on the dashboard of each Ford car in which it was installed. Now Henry Ford was more than just a little anti-Semitic, and there was no way he was going to put the katz\u2019s name on two million Fords. They haggled back and forth for about two hours and finally agreed on $3 million and that just their first names would be shown. And so to this day, all Ford air conditioners show Low, Norm, Hi, and Max on the controls.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Funny Jewish Joke - Clean!", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_25bx5y", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/25bx5y/funny_jewish_joke_clean/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "25bx5y", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "StrayaBoy", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 146, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/25bx5y/funny_jewish_joke_clean/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1399893586.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/25bx5y/funny_jewish_joke_clean/", "created_utc": 1399864786.0, "ups": 146, "num_comments": 4}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>He&#39;s got a strawberry shoved up each nostril, carrots sticking out of his ears, and a hotdog shoved halfway up his ass.  </p>\n\n<p>Hey says, &quot;Doctor, I don&#39;t know what it is, but I feel terrible!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;For starters, you&#39;re not eating right.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "He's got a strawberry shoved up each nostril, carrots sticking out of his ears, and a hotdog shoved halfway up his ass.  \n\nHey says, \"Doctor, I don't know what it is, but I feel terrible!\"\n\n\"For starters, you're not eating right.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A guy walks into the doctor's office...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_25bwtb", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/25bwtb/a_guy_walks_into_the_doctors_office/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "25bwtb", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Migrel", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 73, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/25bwtb/a_guy_walks_into_the_doctors_office/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1399893313.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/25bwtb/a_guy_walks_into_the_doctors_office/", "created_utc": 1399864513.0, "ups": 73, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A little boy runs up to his mother and asks &quot;Mommy mommy I have a question.

Snakes are, well, snakes. After roaming around for about an hour, he hears someone pssst.

I would be a great addition to your household and help you in many ways. In regards to the price, it appears that people are very short sighted and only notice I have no legs. With this being said, I have no doubt that the owners of this establishment would let me go for a song; no pun intended.

He began to walk up and down the aisles looking at the different animals available but found fault with each. Dogs needed to be walked constantly. Cats are loners. Ferrets smell. Fish are boring. Snakes are, well, snakes. After roaming around for about an hour, he hears someone pssst. He turns but doesn't see anyone except a parrot with a sign that reads, \"Intelligent Parrot with no legs. $2500.00\". \n\nThe man walks over and asks, \u201cDid you just call me?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d.

The parrot spoke eloquently. \u201cMay I recommend you purchase me?\u201d \n\nThe man looks at the parrot and after a few moments of contemplation states. \u201cI have some questions. Number one, it reads you are an intelligent parrot. How intelligent? Number two, would your intelligence justify the $2500.00 cost?\u201d\n\nThe parrot seems to puff up and replies, \u201cI am very intelligent. I have studied Philosophy, Psychology and Finance. I would be a great addition to your household and help you in many ways. In regards to the price, it appears that people are very short sighted and only notice I have no legs. With this being said, I have no doubt that the owners of this establishment would let me go for a song; no pun intended. Make an offer and I have no doubt they will accept.\u201d \n\nThe man nods and asks, \u201cYeah, about that. How is that you are perched on that stick?\u201d \n\nThe parrot sighs and answers, \u201cI use my penis. I wrap it around the perch and tighten.
