She took Harry to the principal's office. \n\n\nWhile Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test.  If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.  She agreed. \n\nHarry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. \n\n\nPrincipal: \"What is 3 x 3?\"\n\nHarry: \"9.\"\n\n\nPrincipal: \"What is 6 x 6?\"\n\n\nHarry: \"36.\"\n\nAnd so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. \n\nThe principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, \"I think Harry can go to the 3rdgrade.\"\n\n\nMs. Brooks says to the principal, \"Let me ask him some questions.\"\n\nThe principal and Harry both agreed.\n\n\nMs. Brooks asks, \"What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?\"\n\n\nHarry, after a moment: \"Legs.\"\n\n\nMs Brooks: \"What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?\"\n\n\nThe principal wondered why would she ask such a question! \n\n\nHarry replied: \"Pockets.\"\n\n\nMs. Brooks: \"What does a dog do that a man steps into?\" \n\n\nHarry: \"Pants.\"\n\n\nThe principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open. \n\nMs. Brooks: \"What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?\"\n\nThe principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, \"Bubble gum.\"\n\n\nMs. Brooks: \"What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?\"\n\nHarry: \"Shake hands.\"\n\nThe principal was trembling. \n\n\nMs. Brooks: \"What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?\"\n\nHarry: \"Firetruck.\"\n\nThe principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the \nteacher, \"Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last six questions wrong... \"\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Too smart for the first grade..", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_13wkkd", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13wkkd/too_smart_for_the_first_grade/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "13wkkd", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pansymarks", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 166, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13wkkd/too_smart_for_the_first_grade/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1354091350.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13wkkd/too_smart_for_the_first_grade/", "created_utc": 1354062550.0, "ups": 166, "num_comments": 14}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>You wipe it off and apologize. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "You wipe it off and apologize.

He picks up his ticket from the ticket window, makes his way up to the stands, finds his seat, and gets settled in.\n\nA few minutes later the game starts, and he hears a voice call out from somewhere behind him: \"Charlie!  Hey Charlie!  Turn around, I'm up here!\" The guy turns around and looks at the sea of people behind him, but doesn't see anyone he recognizes, so he turns his attention back to the game.\n\nA few minutes later the same voice calls out from behind him: \"Hey Charlie!  I'm back here you goddamn idiot, turn around!!!\" The guy turns around again, stands up to get a better view, and searches the crowd for a few minutes, but he still doesn't see anyone.\n\nA few minutes later the same voice calls out a third time: \"Hey Charlie!  Are you blind or something!  Turn around, I'm back here!\"  At this point the guy is furious.  He stands up, turns around, and yells into the crowd at the top of his lungs \"Jesus Fucking Christ, MY NAME'S NOT CHARLIE!!!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A guy goes to a football game", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_13vxe2", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13vxe2/a_guy_goes_to_a_football_game/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "13vxe2", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dimideme", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13vxe2/a_guy_goes_to_a_football_game/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1354071592.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13vxe2/a_guy_goes_to_a_football_game/", "created_utc": 1354042792.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>When she sits on your face and you can&#39;t hear your stereo any more.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "When she sits on your face and you can't hear your stereo any more.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "How to tell if you're girlfriend is TOO fat.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_13vvcr", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13vvcr/how_to_tell_if_youre_girlfriend_is_too_fat/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "13vvcr", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChojinDSL", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13vvcr/how_to_tell_if_youre_girlfriend_is_too_fat/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1354069829.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/13vvcr/how_to_tell_if_youre_girlfriend_is_too_fat/", "created_utc": 1354041029.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So three nuns simultaneously die and go to the gates of St. Peter.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst there, St. Peter approaches the nuns and says: &quot;I&#39;m sorry girls,  but heaven&#39;s getting pretty full now.
