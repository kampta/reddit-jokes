They would always boast about who could kill or catch the best animals.\n          Hunter 1 decided to invite hunter 2 over to his house to show off his latest catch. He said he had caught a purple gorilla, the most rare of all the gorillas. Hunter 2 in disbelief goes to his house. As hunter 2 entered he could see hundreds of animal heads mounted on the walls. Hunter 1 goes over to his bookshelf and pulls a book slightly. The bookshelf opens to reveal an enormous staircase leading downward. Hunter 1 motions for hunter 2 to follow him down. As they descend in pitch blackness hunter 2 can make out a room. They approach the room with a single door and a glass container with two aluminum suits inside. Hunter 1 says to put these suits if you don&#39;t want to die. They put the suits on and hunter 1 unlocks the door using a keycard. They enter and as soon as they do bolts of electricity shoot at them rapidly. They are unharmed and make it out safely. They take the suits off and hunter 1 closes the door behind them.\n          Still in pitch blackness they walk for what seems like an eternity, until they come up to a giant pit. Next to the pit are two pairs of rubber boots. They put them on and climb down a ladder into the pit. Inside are thousands of snakes. They start running hoping to reach the end, at the same time brushing the piles of poisonous snakes off of their boots. They reach the end and climb a second ladder to get out. They take their boots off and start to walk again.\n          This time they approach an enormous lake which spreads on for a couple hundred yards. There is a dock at the beginning with a boat and two oars. They climb in the boat and start rowing. Suddenly alligators start to attack them. They row faster all the while knocking the alligators away with the oars. They finally reach the end and get out of the boat.\n          They again walk in pitch blackness and not soon enough approach an absolute gigantic monolith of a door, with a single slot for the keycard hunter 1 used earlier. Hunter 1 swipes the card and the door opens. They walk for a brief time and come upon a second door only a slightly smaller. Hunter 1 swipes the card and they walk through. They again come upon a third door, slightly smaller than the preceding one. This process repeats until they get to a door about a foot tall. Hunter 1 swipes the card and they both crawl through.\n          The door opens up to a dark room. The only thing inside is a cage in the back right corner, big enough to fit an elephant. Hunter 2 notices a figure in the farthest corner. Hunter 2 begins to take a closer look but hunter 1 warns him he may go no closer if cares for his life. Hunter 2&#39;s curiosity gets the best of him. The figure starts to move and hunter 2 can make out the color of it, a deep purple. Hunter 2 now sees the huge beast as the gorilla, hunter 1 was talking about. The gorilla creeps closer to hunter 2. Hunter 2 decides out of his shear insanity that he wants to touch it. He pokes it. The gorilla is furious. The beast breaks open the cage as if it was nothing leaving a huge gaping hole of twisted metal. The hunters run in fear for their lives. Hunter 1 swipes the card for the smallest door and they crawl through. He keeps swiping the card for each consecutive door and they rush through. They reach the last door. Hunter 1 closes it behind them and they keep sprinting. Hunter 2 looks back to see the purple gorilla smashing through each door with ease.\n          The hunters reach the lake. They&#39;re rowing and knocking the alligators off and rowing until they reach the end of the lake. They look back and see the beast jump across the entire lake and keep running towards them. They keep sprinting until they reach the pit of snakes. They put their boots on and jump down. They&#39;re sprinting and brushing the snakes off and sprinting until they reach the end of the pit and climb the ladder to safety. Hunter 2 looks back and sees the gorilla jump into the pit smashing the snakes, ignoring their venomous bites. They keep running as fast as they can until they get to the first room. They put the aluminum suits on and hunter 1 swipes the card so they may enter. They run through the room as lightning bolts bounce off of them. They get to the end of the room and take their suits off. Hunter 1 swipes the card to the room and the door closes behind them.\n          The purple gorilla, still chasing them, rips off the front of the room and throws it aside. He runs through the room ignoring the bolts of lighting. The hunters sprint up the stairs, not looking back, as they know their fate. They reach the top of the stairs and enter the house, closing the book shelf behind them. They cower in the corner hoping their death will be quick.
