I'll call him up\"\n\nRob calls and Obama picks up. \"Hey Rob! Yeah long time no see! I was in the middle of writing a big speech, but you can come over to the White House and we can chill.\"\n\nThey arrive at the White House, Rob arm in arm with Obama as they talk about the past. The boss is speechless, and the next day, comes up to Rob.\n\n\"I still don't quite believe you. If you know everyone, then hook me up with Michael Jordan.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah! Sure! Jordan and I used to be on the same basketball team! I'll call him up\"\n\nRob calls and Michael Jordan picks up. \"Hey Rob! Yeah long time no see! I was in the middle of teaching my son some basketball, but you can come over to my mansion and we can chill.\"\n\nThey arrive at the mansion, Rob arm in arm with Michael Jordan as they talk about the past.. Again, the boss is speechless, but still doesn't quite believe Rob. The next day, the boss comes up to Rob.\n\n\"Okay, this is the last thing. I still am not 100% with you, but if you show me that you're friends with the Pope, I'll believe you\"\n\n\"Oh yeah! Sure! The Pope and I used to go to the same church together! I'll call him up\"\n\nRob calls and the Pope picks up. \"Hey Rob! Yeah long time no see! I was about to prepare for a big speech for the masses. Hey why don't you join me in my Popemobile and preach to the masses together\"\n\nAnd sure enough, Rob and the Pope sat in the Popemobile, arm in arm, waving to the people while driving across the Vatican. But when the day ends, Rob finds that his boss was sent to the hospital due to a heart attack.\n\nAt the hospital, Rob finds his boss, slowly recovering, and says \"Hey boss, sorry about your heart attack. Was seeing me with the Pope too much for you?\"\n\n\"No, it's not that. I admit I was surprised when I saw you next to the Pope, arm in arm, but what gave me a heart attack was when the guy next to me said \"Hey, who's that guy next to Rob?\"\"", "likes": null,
