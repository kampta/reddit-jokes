People are amazed! \nThe owner of the bar offers the man free drinks all evening and at closing time he asks: 'I'm sorry, but where did you get him?' \nWell, said the man, I found an old oillamp and when I was cleaning it a ghost came out and told me that I could make a whish. \nO, said the barkeeper, do you still have that lamp? Yes, said the man. Could you bring it tomorrow, asked the barkeeper. \nI'll do that, said the man.\n Next evening the man brought the lamp, the barkeeper cleaned it up and the ghost came out. \nYou can make a wish, said the ghost to the barkeeper. \nI wish a million bucks, said the barkeeper.\n Right at that moment thousands and thousands of ducks came flying in the bar, shitting everywhere.\n I don't understand, said the barkeeper, I've asked for bucks, not ducks! \nWell, said the man, do you really think I've asked for a 10 inch pianist? \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Ghost", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_t819u", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/t819u/ghost/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "t819u", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Drakeman43", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 45, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/t819u/ghost/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1336225699.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/t819u/ghost/", "created_utc": 1336196899.0, "ups": 45, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A seal walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a drink.</p>\n\n<p>The bartender asks the seal, &quot;What&#39;s your pleasure?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The seal replies, &quot;Anything but Canadian Club.&quot;
