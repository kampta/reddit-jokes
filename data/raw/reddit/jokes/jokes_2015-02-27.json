The devil shows him the second room which has a bunch of people standing around with faeces up to their necks. The devil shows him the third and last room which has people sitting around a table drinking tea with faeces up to their knees. The devil then asks him which room he wants to spend eternity in. The man says \"I would like to go in the third room\". The devil lets him in and the man sits for a cup of tea. As the devil is leaving the room he calls to the occupants \"Ok everyone tea break is over, start standing on your heads\".", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A man arrives in hell", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2xb8v6", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2xb8v6/a_man_arrives_in_hell/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2xb8v6", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Darbvader", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2xb8v6/a_man_arrives_in_hell/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1425035879.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2xb8v6/a_man_arrives_in_hell/", "created_utc": 1425007079.0, "ups": 3, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Little Johnny and Little Sammy were talking one night before bed.
