Perhaps even worse was the low-quality stream of Nickelback's back catalogue playing through tinny mobile phone speakers on the ceiling. \n\n'Not for you?' asks the Devil. 'Oh... ok then. How about Door Number 2?'\n\nPhil didn't think there was anything in the collected history of human experience worse than what he had just seen, but he had to recalibrate when he saw the next room. People were standing up to their necks in post-curry turds; any attempt to raise an arm to wipe their sweating foreheads just splashed the poor soul next to them, who them splashed them back. It was awful. And Frankee's FURB was playing at an uncomfortably high volume.\n\n'Yeah, I'm really not sure why people keep on choosing that room,' said the Devil as he closed the door. 'Alright then Phil, one last door to open.'\n\nWhile still stomach-churning, the room behind Door Number Three was almost pedestrian compared to the last two. Faeces still reached up to the occupants' shins, but they were all stood around drinking coffee - albeit cold - and smoking cigarettes - albeit menthols. The music wasn't half bad either, comparatively speaking. I mean, everyone likes Cher *deep down*, don't they?\n\n'Door Number 3, I choose Door Number 3!' shouted Phil. 'Please oh please make it Door Number 3.'\n\n'Well OK,' replied the Devil, somewhat surprised. 'I mean, if that's your thing. Come on then, in you go.'\n\nA polite shove and Phil was in the room. No one acknowledged him, they were too busy taking long pulls from their cigarettes and frantically drinking their coffee.\n\nThe Cher cut out and was replaced by the Devil's voice. 'OK guys, coffee break's over. Back on your heads, please.'\n\nEdit: hurrrr homophones", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Phil dies and is met by the Devil in front of three doors.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_26vdgq", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26vdgq/phil_dies_and_is_met_by_the_devil_in_front_of/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "26vdgq", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EroticSubtext", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1401474485.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26vdgq/phil_dies_and_is_met_by_the_devil_in_front_of/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1401483724.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26vdgq/phil_dies_and_is_met_by_the_devil_in_front_of/", "created_utc": 1401454924.0, "ups": 29, "num_comments": 7}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>How can you tell a mechanic has just had sex?

The first woman asks \"What on earth is that?\" \"Oh, it's a condom, they're designed to protect your cigarette from the rain,\" the second replies.\n\nNow the next day, the lady who tossed her cig went down to the drug store to pick up some condoms so she can smoke in the rain.  She asks the clerk \"Can you please sell me some condoms?\"  The clerk is confused as to why this old lady would need rubbers, but in the interest of customer satisfaction, he says \"Sure, what kind would you like?\"  To this the old woman responds,\"Oh, I suppose it doesn't really matter.  Just make sure it can fit a camel.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "So, two old ladies are outside on a bench smoking...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_26uhqr", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26uhqr/so_two_old_ladies_are_outside_on_a_bench_smoking/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "26uhqr", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UltimateDanger508", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26uhqr/so_two_old_ladies_are_outside_on_a_bench_smoking/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1401449624.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26uhqr/so_two_old_ladies_are_outside_on_a_bench_smoking/", "created_utc": 1401420824.0, "ups": 9, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Rebbit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Rebbit.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What do you call an awesome internet site for frogs?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_26uhos", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26uhos/what_do_you_call_an_awesome_internet_site_for/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "26uhos", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CTopherW", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26uhos/what_do_you_call_an_awesome_internet_site_for/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1401449577.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26uhos/what_do_you_call_an_awesome_internet_site_for/", "created_utc": 1401420777.0, "ups": 5, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A man has a job interview at the zoo.
