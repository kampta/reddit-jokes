Like, lots. He&#39;s got Tractor wallpaper with Tractor posters, Tractor bedsheets, his shelves are covered in Tractor models and he wear a denim jacket all covered in Tractor patches. And one day this kid (let&#39;s call him Dave) is walking home from school when he spies the new Crop-Master 5000, the most advanced Tractor in the world, sitting in the field near his house.\nNaturally Dave has to take a closer look. So he breaks into the field and wanders over to the Tractor, keeping an eye out for the farmer as he does so. When he gets closer, Dave can hardly believe his eyes, this thing is beautiful, sleek and powerful with big yellow wheels and a full leather seat. Trying the door, Dave realises the cabin is open, and so he sits inside the Tractor for a little while when he realises that the key is still in the ignition!\nHardly containing himself, Dave just can&#39;t resist. He turns on the Tractor, puts it in gear, and starts trundling about. Now, I don&#39;t know if you fully understand but this is a big thing for Dave. This is like all of Dave&#39;s christmasses and birthdays all come at once.\nSo Dave is having a whale of a time when all of a sudden, out comes the Farmer! And in a thick Somerset accent he yells, &quot;what you doin&#39; in there, boy! Get the hell out of my Tra&#39;er! You can&#39;t drive that you&#39;re rubbish get out of it!&quot;\nDave is mortified and runs all the way home. Out of the field, down the road, round the corner and into his house. He runs past his mother, straight up to his room and falls on to his bed. Through the haze of tears after many hours of crying he eventually gets up and sees the Crop-Master 5000 poster opposite his bed... &quot;Nothing will make me feel like that again!&quot; he cries, &quot;I&#39;ll make sure of it!&quot; and he tears the poster off the wall. In a fit of rage he destroys every last piece of Tractor memorabilia he owns, even down to tearing the patches off his favorite denim jacket. Dave then becomes a recluse, and, save for school, doesn&#39;t leave his room for over seven years.\nEventually his mother has had enough and she goes to Dave to talk some sense in to him. &quot;Dave&quot; she says, &quot;I know you&#39;re still upset about what happened with the farmer, but he&#39;s apologised and you need to move on with your life. Please, for me, and for your father. Go out, find some friends, get a job, just do something. Please?&quot;\nSo, wanting to make his mother happy, Dave pulls on his old denim jacket, which, by now is way too small and full of holes. And he walks to the pub.\nWhen he gets there, he pushes the door open and is immediately greeted by a thick waft of Cigarette smoke. Coughing, he wanders up to the bar. &quot;Pint of lager please.&quot; &quot;Ay lad.&quot; Dave sits and, struggling to get comfortable on the rickety old stool, surveys his surroundings. The barman brings him his drink and Dave pays for it, then, after taking a swig. He lets out a sigh, and all the smoke in the room clears.\nThe barman is startled, to say the least. &quot;What on earth was that?!&quot; &quot;What?&quot; replies Dave. &quot;The smoke!

wealthy through a lot of hard work and some shrewd business dealings. He was known as a hard man with few weaknesses and, being such, he had little patience for weakness in others. He was getting past middle age and had accomplished all of the goals that he had set for himself, so he decided to find a woman with whom he could share the fruits of his labor and who could be a companion to him in his twilight years. But being the rugged frontier, the only unattached women were soiled doves of ill repute. It was unacceptable for a man of his social standing to marry a whore, so he did what men of his day did in his situation - he wrote back east for a mail order bride.  After months of correspondence with several different women he finally settled on one that suited him. He sent her a marriage proposal and she sent back her acceptance. They set a date and she boarded a train. He met her at the train station upon her arrival where they introduced themselves and exchanged pleasantries. Having become briefly acquainted, they walked across to the Justice of the Peace and were quickly married while the porter loaded the woman&#39;s luggage into the rancher&#39;s wagon. The newlyweds then left town and headed to the ranch on a particularly hot day in June. A few miles outside of town, the horse pulling the wagon swayed a bit and then stumbled. The rancher pulled up on the reigns, hopped down from the wagon, walked in front of the horse, and stared hard into its eyes for a moment before raising a solitary finger and saying in a firm tone &quot;THAT&#39;S ONCE.&quot; He got back into the wagon and headed off again. They had gone only a mile further when the horse swayed and stumbled again. Once again the old rancher jumped down from the wagon, approached the horse, and stared hard into its eyes before raising two fingers and admonishing the horse &quot;THAT&#39;S TWICE.&quot; He climbed back into the wagon, snapped the reigns and headed off towards the ranch. The horse did well for the next three or four miles but then fatigue and the unrelenting heat got the better of him and he swayed yet again, stumbled mightily, almost fell, and nearly caused the wagon to tip over.

He was known as a hard man with few weaknesses and, being such, he had little patience for weakness in others. He was getting past middle age and had accomplished all of the goals that he had set for himself, so he decided to find a woman with whom he could share the fruits of his labor and who could be a companion to him in his twilight years. But being the rugged frontier, the only unattached women were soiled doves of ill repute. It was unacceptable for a man of his social standing to marry a whore, so he did what men of his day did in his situation - he wrote back east for a mail order bride.  After months of correspondence with several different women he finally settled on one that suited him. He sent her a marriage proposal and she sent back her acceptance. They set a date and she boarded a train. He met her at the train station upon her arrival where they introduced themselves and exchanged pleasantries. Having become briefly acquainted, they walked across to the Justice of the Peace and were quickly married while the porter loaded the woman's luggage into the rancher's wagon. The newlyweds then left town and headed to the ranch on a particularly hot day in June. A few miles outside of town, the horse pulling the wagon swayed a bit and then stumbled. The rancher pulled up on the reigns, hopped down from the wagon, walked in front of the horse, and stared hard into its eyes for a moment before raising a solitary finger and saying in a firm tone \"THAT'S ONCE.\" He got back into the wagon and headed off again. They had gone only a mile further when the horse swayed and stumbled again. Once again the old rancher jumped down from the wagon, approached the horse, and stared hard into its eyes before raising two fingers and admonishing the horse \"THAT'S TWICE.\" He climbed back into the wagon, snapped the reigns and headed off towards the ranch. The horse did well for the next three or four miles but then fatigue and the unrelenting heat got the better of him and he swayed yet again, stumbled mightily, almost fell, and nearly caused the wagon to tip over. The rancher, noticeably agitated now, said through gritted teeth \"DAMMIT, THAT'S THREE TIMES!\" He reached under the seat of the wagon, pulled out a shotgun, walked up to the horse, put the barrel up to its head and pulled the trigger, dropping the animal stone dead on the ground. The woman was aghast at witnessing such a thing and exclaimed \"WHY did you do THAT?!\" The rancher said \"Honey, that horse weren't no good, but don't you worry your pretty little head none, it's not even five miles to the ranch from here, we can just walk the rest of the way and I can carry most of the luggage.\" His new bride was unsatisfied with this answer and began to loudly voice her displeasure - \"Five Miles!
