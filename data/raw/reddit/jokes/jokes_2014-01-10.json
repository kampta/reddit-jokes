The cat was already walking up the driveway when he approached his home. \nThe next day, he decided to drop the cat 40 blocks away but the same thing happened. \nHe kept on increasing the number of blocks but the cat kept on coming home before him. At last he decided to drive a few miles away, turn right, then left, past the bridge, then right again and another right and so on until he reached what he thought was a perfect spot and dropped the cat there. \nHours later, the man calls his wife at home and asked her, \"Jen is the cat there?\" \"Yes, why do you ask?\" answered the wife. Frustrated the man said, \"Put that cat on the phone, I am lost and I need directions.\" \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Cat Hating Husband", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1uv47o", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1uv47o/cat_hating_husband/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1uv47o", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "oxphantomwarriorxo", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 34, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1uv47o/cat_hating_husband/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1389362567.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1uv47o/cat_hating_husband/", "created_utc": 1389333767.0, "ups": 34, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A Scottish tourist attended his first baseball game in the US and after a base hit he hears the fans roaring &quot;Run....Run!&quot; \nThe next batter connects heavily with the ball and the Scotsman stands up and roars with the crowd in his thick accent: &quot;R-r-run ya bahstard, r-run will ya!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>A third batter hits a slam and again the Scotsman, obviously pleased with his knowledge of the game, screams &quot;R-r-run ya bahstard, r-r-run will ya!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>The next batter steadfastly holds his swing four times and as the ump calls a walk the Scotsman stands up and yells &quot;R-r-run ya bahstard, r-r-run!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>All the surrounding fans giggle quietly and he sits down confused.
