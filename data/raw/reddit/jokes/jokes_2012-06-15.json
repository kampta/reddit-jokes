There are 2 guys in line before me and St. Pete looks bored, he says \n\n\"I'm bored as fuck so here's what we're gonna do I'll let you guys in only if you can tell me a story i haven't heard  before.\" \n\nSo first guy says \"Alright let me tell you about my day: I'm pretty sure my girlfriend is cheating on me so i head home early from work to the apartment we share.  Sure enough there she is naked in bed, but all by herself.  I check the closet, no one there. Check the bathroom, nothing.  Check the whole apartment and and cant find anyone. Then i noticed the door to the balcony is open and wouldn't you know it there some guy hanging by his finger tips off the bottom of the balcony ledge.  So I grab a hammer and start slamming the shit out of his hands and he falls off into some bushes. I hear him moaning so I know the little fucker is still alive.  I yank the refrigerator out of the freakin wall drag it over the balcony and dropped it on him, but the strain gave me a heart attack and here i am.\"\n\nSaint Pete says \"well that is some crazy shit, come on in.\" First guy goes on in and he turns to the second guy and says \"What about you buddy? Got a good story?\"\n\nSecond guy says \"Well your not gonna believe this but its all true. Today i woke up and decide to start getting back in shape.  I did a work out video and then need to find a place to do some pull ups. I use my balcony and jump up to grab the ledge of the balcony above me. Wouldn't you know it as soon as i did some psycho comes out and smashes my hands with a hammer, i fall to the ground and break both my legs, some bushes broke my fall or i would have died right then and there.  As I'm trying to crawl away a freakin refrigerator falls on me, and here i am.\"\n\nSt Petey says \"well i got let you in that is messed up.\"  So second guy goes into heaven. Then he turns to me and says \"How you could possible top those stories?\"\n\nAnd I say \"Okay picture this: I'm naked in a refrigerator...\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Three stories at the pearly gates...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_v1veo", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v1veo/three_stories_at_the_pearly_gates/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "v1veo", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fernhead", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 34, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v1veo/three_stories_at_the_pearly_gates/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1339721110.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/v1veo/three_stories_at_the_pearly_gates/", "created_utc": 1339692310.0, "ups": 34, "num_comments": 4}]
