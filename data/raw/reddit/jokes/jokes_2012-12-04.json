Bob looks at his wife and says:\n\n-I'm gonna go talk to Timmy.\n\nHe walks to Timmy's room, opens the door, and freezes. Timmy is on his bed fucking his grandmother. Bob is flabbergasted.\n\n-WHAT THE FUCK!!! says Bob.\n\nTo which Timmy replies calmly:\n\n-It's not so funny when it's your mother now is it?!?\n\n\n\n(All credits go to Robin Williams!)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Motherfucker", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_147eer", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/147eer/motherfucker/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "147eer", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tehteh67", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/147eer/motherfucker/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1354580246.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/147eer/motherfucker/", "created_utc": 1354551446.0, "ups": 29, "num_comments": 4}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Do you even lift?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Do you even lift?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What did the Wonderbra say to the regular bra?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_147e04", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/147e04/what_did_the_wonderbra_say_to_the_regular_bra/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "147e04", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "critercat", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 85, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/147e04/what_did_the_wonderbra_say_to_the_regular_bra/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1354579851.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/147e04/what_did_the_wonderbra_say_to_the_regular_bra/", "created_utc": 1354551051.0, "ups": 85, "num_comments": 2}]
