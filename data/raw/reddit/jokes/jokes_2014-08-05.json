So, the next day Ms. Johnson approaches Jacob when he raises his hand like he always does, and ask him, \"Why don't you get this, what don't you understand?\" Jacob replies, \"I've gotten it all along, you're the one who kept putting their boobs in my face.\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Jacob is having trouble with math.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2cn24l", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2cn24l/jacob_is_having_trouble_with_math/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2cn24l", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MolestButterflies", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2cn24l/jacob_is_having_trouble_with_math/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1407226371.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2cn24l/jacob_is_having_trouble_with_math/", "created_utc": 1407197571.0, "ups": 4, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Because when he drank whisky, he got <em>mean</em>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Because when he drank whisky, he got *mean*.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Why didn't Hitler drink whisky?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2cn14b", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2cn14b/why_didnt_hitler_drink_whisky/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2cn14b", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bluefoot55", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2cn14b/why_didnt_hitler_drink_whisky/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1407225752.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2cn14b/why_didnt_hitler_drink_whisky/", "created_utc": 1407196952.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 4}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just one, but the light bulb is going to need to change itself. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Just one, but the light bulb is going to need to change itself.
