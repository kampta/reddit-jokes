I was so exited and mad and pumped, that I had a heart attack from it, and now I'm here\".The gatekeeper, fascinated by the story said, \"Wow, you really did have a bad day didn't you? Go on through sir. The man obliged, and went on his way through the pearly gates.  \n\nThe second man finally approached the gate, and the gatekeeper was eager to hear his story. He asked him how his day was to which he responded, \"Well at first it wasn't too bad. I was starting out the day by getting an intense workout done on my 7th story balcony. But then I kinda got a little carried away a bit and found myself hanging from the outside of my balcony. To make matters worse, I see this crazy pissed off guy on the story below me thrust the door open, and started jabbing at my torso. I couldn't hold on any longer, and fell down about 6 stories to where a tree broke my fall. The last thing I remember was laying on my back in massive pain when I see a little dot start to get bigger. As soon as I could tell that it was a fridge, everything went black and I ended up here. The Angel told him, \"That truly is a terrible way to go! Make your way through sir, i'll open the gates for you.\" The man proceeds through while the gatekeeper says to himself \"I could get used to this. Hehe.\" \n\n The the third guy goes up to the gates and the gatekeeper then says, \"Hello there sir, before I could let you in, I must ask, how was your day?\" The man then tells the gatekeeper, \"You're never gonna believe what happened to me. Picture this, I'm naked, in a fridge...\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "It was getting crowded in heaven....(Kinda long)", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1zc50y", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1zc50y/it_was_getting_crowded_in_heavenkinda_long/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1zc50y", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ghostpastries", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1393755786.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1zc50y/it_was_getting_crowded_in_heavenkinda_long/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1393783621.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1zc50y/it_was_getting_crowded_in_heavenkinda_long/", "created_utc": 1393754821.0, "ups": 13, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why did the baker have dirty hands?</p>\n\n<p>Because he kneaded a poo....
