One day Ninety&#39;s 3 kids, 2 daughters and a son found a stray puppy in the woods. They were so excited and brought him home. However Ninety&#39;s wife Anne had a terrible fear of dogs. So Ninety&#39;s kids had to hid the dog. They name him &#39;This&#39; so that they could referred to him in code without raising suspicion. It was hard taking care of him in the basement of the house without Anne or Ninety finding out.

She had many husband and would bear many kids with each husband. By the end of her fertility period she had given birth to a 100 kids! In order to remember all their names she had to name them by the order they were born. ( So she hand one, two, three and so on). \n\nWell she obviously had a hard time financing things with so many kids and so many husbands on the run, that she was forced to live in a very small cabin with her children in the middle of nowhere. It was cramped and awful, kids of all sizes stuffed in a few rooms, with no place to run around and be themselves!\n Due to their tight living conditions one day, 32 was messing around with a magnifying glass, burning ants, when whoosh! The whole house caught on fire!!\n\nThe flames engulfed the whole land around them, and people from towns miles away saw the smoke and felt nothing but sorrow for ol' Marge and her kids. However 1 kid survived, Ninety. \n\nNinety went on to live a very successful and had a loving family of his own. They lived in the outskirts of the city and had a marvelous life. One day Ninety's 3 kids, 2 daughters and a son found a stray puppy in the woods. They were so excited and brought him home. However Ninety's wife Anne had a terrible fear of dogs. So Ninety's kids had to hid the dog. They name him 'This' so that they could referred to him in code without raising suspicion. It was hard taking care of him in the basement of the house without Anne or Ninety finding out. One day Anne was wondering why they kids spent so much time in the basement and come down to check on them. The kids not knowing what to do, propped the window open and let 'This' out! He ran away and was never seen again, by anyone!\n\n\nAnd so only 90's kids will remember this\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A joke for the older generations", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1jkz5r", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jkz5r/a_joke_for_the_older_generations/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1jkz5r", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "abujad", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 255, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jkz5r/a_joke_for_the_older_generations/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1375499985.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jkz5r/a_joke_for_the_older_generations/", "created_utc": 1375471185.0, "ups": 255, "num_comments": 21}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>He was fucking nuts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "He was fucking nuts.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Did you hear about the guy who tried to have sex with an acorn?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1jkxzt", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jkxzt/did_you_hear_about_the_guy_who_tried_to_have_sex/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1jkxzt", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Corcast", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jkxzt/did_you_hear_about_the_guy_who_tried_to_have_sex/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1375499101.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jkxzt/did_you_hear_about_the_guy_who_tried_to_have_sex/", "created_utc": 1375470301.0, "ups": 17, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So these two drunks were walking down the street one day and one looks at the other and says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey man, when is the last time you had any pussy?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The other drunk says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hell its been a long time.
