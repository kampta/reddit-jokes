While it talks about Clakr's \"great-grandbear Joa\" it doesn't mention any of his other family members, nor the real reason why he is the new mascot.\n\nAt a regular checkup, a zoo member noticed some bruises on Clark's body & DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) was called in to investigate.\n\n---\n\nAfter the DCFS social worker arrived they asked if Clark's father hits him.\n\n*Yes, my dad beats often me when he is mad* - Clark responded.\n\nDCFS - *What about your mother?*\n\nClark - *She beats me when I get in trouble.*\n\nDCFS - *Well can we send you to live with your grandparents in the north woods?*\n\nClark - *No, they'd beat me even worse for being a city bear.*\n\nDCFS - *So who do you want to live with?*\n\nClark - *The Chicago Cubs, because they can't beat anyone.*", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "So the Chicago Cubs have a new
