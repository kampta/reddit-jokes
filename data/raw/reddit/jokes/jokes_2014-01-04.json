Noticing the length of her skirt and the location of the raisin bread, he has a brilliant idea. \"I'd like some raisin bread please,\" the man says politely. The girl nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which is located on the very top shelf. The young man, standing almost directly beneath her, gets an excellent view just as he planned. Once she comes down he says he should get two loaves, as he is having company for dinner. As the girl retrieves the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices what is going on. Thinking quickly, he requests his own loaf of raisin bread so he can continue to enjoy the view. With each trip up the ladder, the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon, each male customer is asking for raisin bread, just to see her climb up and down. After many trips she is tired, irritated and thinking that she is really going to have to try the bread herself. Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd, staring up at her. Thinking to save herself a trip, she yells at the elderly man: \"Is it raisin for you, too?\" \"No,\" stammers the old man: \"but it's quivering a bit!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Raisin Bread", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1ubrnv", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ubrnv/raisin_bread/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1ubrnv", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "klaushkee", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 90, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ubrnv/raisin_bread/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1388802044.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ubrnv/raisin_bread/", "created_utc": 1388773244.0, "ups": 90, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>An oil rig mechanic returns to his cabin after his shift and discovers his cabinmate sitting on the edge of his bunk, his feet in a basin, hastily scraping a razor over his soaped-up legs.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Um, hey, what are you up to?&quot; asks the mechanic.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I was talking to old Joe in the canteen today,&quot; says his cabinmate, &quot;and I mentioned I was feeling homesick.
