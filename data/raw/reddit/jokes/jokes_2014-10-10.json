They all look in absolute amazement.\n&quot;Hurry man! Another shot!&quot;\nHe tips the drink into his sons mouth and BOOM! Another cloud of smoke and the boy sprouts two arms.\n&quot;Hurry man!

It&#39;s his brother, the dentist.  He picks up.  &quot;Hey bro.  You&#39;ll never believe what happened.  Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car.

Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper asks \"What do you have in mind?\"  \n  \nThe dentist thinks.  \"How about a challenge?  If I beat you, you let my brother go free.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper laughs.  \"I will beat you in any challenge.  What challenge do you propose?\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles.  \"I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth.  5 minute of brushing each, then we decide.\"  \n  \n\"Very well\" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  \n  \nOnce there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull.  It's glistening.  He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes.  After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright.  The grim reaper grins.  \"You are foolish human.  But, you are entitled to your chance.\"\n  \nThe dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman.  When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste.  He smiles.  \n  \nIt's unbelievable.  \n  \nThe shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  \n  \nThe winner is obvious.  The grim reaper hangs his head in shame.  \"You win, human.  This time.  Your brother will live.\"  He disappears in a puff of smoke.  At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital.  Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy.  Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings.  It's his brother, the dentist.  He picks up.  \"Hey bro.  You'll never believe what happened.  Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car.  They say I almost died.\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles on the phone and says.  \"That's interesting, bro.  Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.\"  ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 1, "archived": true, "clicked": false,
