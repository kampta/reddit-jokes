They seemed to still be talking about the incident in Suite 103. Adam noticed one girl in particular: a blonde, around 22 years of age who he knew would have a wonderful smile if she allowed one to occupy her face. A smile seemed out of the question for her, though. She seemed to feel more uncomfortable talking about the \u201csuicide\u201d than the other workers, and upon learning she worked with the housekeeping staff, Adam knew she was his way in. </p>\n\n<p>He waited for her to enter the restroom and seated himself close enough for her to notice him when she walked out, but far enough away to be covert about it. Thinking about Alexa was all Adam needed for tears to begin streaming down his face.

He noticed the bullet hole in the wall didn\u2019t make much sense with what he expected based on evidence from Alexa\u2019s head, but that was all speculation since Adam didn\u2019t get to observe the initial investigation.</p>\n\n<p>Over a period of nine days, Adam visited Suite 103 each day for a half hour. He noticed nothing that the investigation hadn\u2019t already revealed. He went home on day nine and thought that maybe he didn\u2019t know his wife as well as he thought he did. He tried to convince himself that his efforts weren\u2019t all for naught, but nothing seemed to support that idea. </p>\n\n<p>As he was drowning in those depressing thoughts, he realized that there was one thing he hadn\u2019t looked at. Investigators avoid searching sheets and any other form of fabric for fingerprints because the material does not hold the prints like a glossy and hard surface does; however, that hotel room had a blanket over the comforter on the bed that was mainly there for aesthetic appeal. This blanket had some sort of glossy coating on it from what Adam had observed when he removed it from the bed on day one. If there were one place from which someone wouldn\u2019t think to clean their fingerprints, that place would be on a blanket. </p>\n\n<p>Adam couldn\u2019t wait for the next night. He grabbed his supplies for revealing prints and his key to the suite and rushed back to the hotel. He hurried through the doors and saw Alex whose eyes widened upon seeing him. She vigorously shook her head, but Adam ignored it and jogged to the suite, opening the door and entering. He began applying a powdery residue to the glossy blanket. </p>\n\n<p>The door swung open and the hotel manager\u2019s silhouette came into view on the mirror in front of the door. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cGET OUT!\u201d he screamed. </p>\n\n<p>Adam knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to reason with the hotel manager, so he just kept searching the blanket for fingerprints. Adam worked through the hotel manager calling the police and worked through the hotel manager\u2019s constant screaming. Sure enough, the blanket was covered in prints. Prints from multiple people. Prints from more people than were involved in his wife\u2019s death, but Adam knew that some of them belonged to her killer. </p>\n\n<p>Seconds after this revelation, Adam\u2019s arm was grasped firmly and he was handcuffed and brought to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNO! My wife was killed! Murdered! The killer\u2019s prints are on that sheet! I know it!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The officers would not listen and they led Adam to the doorway. Adam walked away from his life and left his heart on that blanket. As the hotel room door closed, Adam turned back toward the room as a single tear streamed down his cheek. Emotion overwhelmed his voice as he opened his mouth and whispered, \u201cGood night, suite prints.\u201d</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "**There is no TL;DR to this joke.

He noticed the bullet hole in the wall didn\u2019t make much sense with what he expected based on evidence from Alexa\u2019s head, but that was all speculation since Adam didn\u2019t get to observe the initial investigation.\n\n\nOver a period of nine days, Adam visited Suite 103 each day for a half hour. He noticed nothing that the investigation hadn\u2019t already revealed. He went home on day nine and thought that maybe he didn\u2019t know his wife as well as he thought he did. He tried to convince himself that his efforts weren\u2019t all for naught, but nothing seemed to support that idea. \n\n\nAs he was drowning in those depressing thoughts, he realized that there was one thing he hadn\u2019t looked at. Investigators avoid searching sheets and any other form of fabric for fingerprints because the material does not hold the prints like a glossy and hard surface does; however, that hotel room had a blanket over the comforter on the bed that was mainly there for aesthetic appeal. This blanket had some sort of glossy coating on it from what Adam had observed when he removed it from the bed on day one. If there were one place from which someone wouldn\u2019t think to clean their fingerprints, that place would be on a blanket. \n\n\nAdam couldn\u2019t wait for the next night. He grabbed his supplies for revealing prints and his key to the suite and rushed back to the hotel. He hurried through the doors and saw Alex whose eyes widened upon seeing him. She vigorously shook her head, but Adam ignored it and jogged to the suite, opening the door and entering. He began applying a powdery residue to the glossy blanket. \n\n\nThe door swung open and the hotel manager\u2019s silhouette came into view on the mirror in front of the door. \n\n\n\u201cGET OUT!\u201d he screamed. \n\n\nAdam knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to reason with the hotel manager, so he just kept searching the blanket for fingerprints. Adam worked through the hotel manager calling the police and worked through the hotel manager\u2019s constant screaming. Sure enough, the blanket was covered in prints. Prints from multiple people. Prints from more people than were involved in his wife\u2019s death, but Adam knew that some of them belonged to her killer. \n\n\nSeconds after this revelation, Adam\u2019s arm was grasped firmly and he was handcuffed and brought to his feet. \n\n\n\u201cNO! My wife was killed! Murdered! The killer\u2019s prints are on that sheet! I know it!\u201d \n\n\nThe officers would not listen and they led Adam to the doorway. Adam walked away from his life and left his heart on that blanket. As the hotel room door closed, Adam turned back toward the room as a single tear streamed down his cheek. Emotion overwhelmed his voice as he opened his mouth and whispered, \u201cGood night, suite prints.\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Suite 103", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1ek7a2", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ek7a2/suite_103/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1ek7a2", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UrethraPlug", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ek7a2/suite_103/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1368878558.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ek7a2/suite_103/", "created_utc": 1368849758.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 12}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>And a redneck knocks on the door.
