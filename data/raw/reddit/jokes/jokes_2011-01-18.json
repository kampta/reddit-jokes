Perhaps I could sweeten the deal with you. Ruritania, although a small country, is known for wealth. The treasury is packed with great riches that I\u2019m sure my father would be happy to impart onto you should you assist our country in its time of need. The desire for the amount money you will obtain has driven men mad with obsession. And again, all you have to do is kiss me, nothing more, and I will take responsibility for everything else.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hearing this, the nerd takes the frog out of his pocket and laughs uncontrollably for minutes at the frog.

Lust for power has been the driving ambition throughout history for all men of means. I see that you wish to gain power over the people of Ruritania. Your perspicacious self-control in this matter demonstrates your ability to prosper in the realm of politics. And, although I am wary to admit it, taking the chance on the possibility of your being an unwise ruler is far more satisfying than accepting the certain tyranny of the conspirators in power now. So I offer you the reward of presidential power for life in exchange for your touching your lips against mine.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The nerd can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s hearing. He stops for minutes, laughing out loud to the point of tears before finally settling down and continuing on his journey.</p>\n\n<p>Viciously, the frog blares out a whine of defeat and continues on: &quot;Yes! I know what it is you men desire. I will marry you, if you wish. And you can abuse me in any way you feel the need. Use my body, for your own pleasure or for others! Make me sleep with other men\u2026 women\u2026 animals! I don\u2019t care! Nothing you do to me could be any worse than staying in this hideous form any longer. I beg of you! Please release me from this curse! All you have to do is kiss my lips and I will grant any of your desires for the rest of my natural life. Please just do this for me!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hearing this last plea, the nerd explodes in laughter, rolling on his back in spazmatic joy, unable to contain any fluids for what appeared like an eternity before finally having enough strength to get back up and continue on his walk.</p>\n\n<p>Perplexed, the frog cries out: &quot;I don\u2019t understand!
