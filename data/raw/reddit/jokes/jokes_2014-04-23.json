The bartender is in shock, an actual horse just walked into his bar, sat down at the bar like a person, and ordered a beer in perfect English. He tells the horse, </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry sir, I just have to go speak to my manager for a moment.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So the bartender goes to the back, and explains the situation to his manager. The manager thinks for a moment and then says to the bartender,</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Okay look, this is a bar so go ahead and serve that horse a beer. However considering he&#39;s a horse, he probably doesn&#39;t know how much beer costs, so go ahead and charge him $50 for it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The bartender shrugs and goes back to the front, where the horse is still sitting, visibly watching football on the TV. The bartender gets to the bar and asks the horse,</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Okay, what&#39;ll you have?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The horse turns back around and says,</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Gimme an IPA&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So the bartender pours him an IPA, and slides the beer across to him. He then slowly slides the $50 check across the bar to the horse. The horse picks up the check with his hooves, passively looks at it, pulls out his credit card, slowly slides it and the check back, and then calmly goes back to watching the game as he laps his beer.

She points at a boy in the front row. \"The worm is swimming around in the glass,\" he replies, smiling proudly.\n\n\"Very good,\" says the teacher, exchanging the glasses, then holding up the one with the whiskey in it. \"Now what can you tell me about *this* worm?\"\n\nThe same boy pipes up again. \"That worm isn't moving. I think its dead,\" he says.\n\n\"That's right,\" says the teacher. \"So what does that tell you about drinking whiskey?\"\n\nAt that moment , a boy from the middle of the classroom stands up, smiles, and says \"If you drink whiskey, you'll never get worms!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Dad told me this one several years ago", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_23ot0d", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/23ot0d/dad_told_me_this_one_several_years_ago/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "23ot0d", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Valsartan", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 35, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/23ot0d/dad_told_me_this_one_several_years_ago/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1398212248.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/23ot0d/dad_told_me_this_one_several_years_ago/", "created_utc": 1398183448.0, "ups": 35, "num_comments": 5}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s a rocky road to addiction.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "It's a rocky road to addiction.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "I cant stop eating ice cream...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_23os91", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/23os91/i_cant_stop_eating_ice_cream/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "23os91", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gasface", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/23os91/i_cant_stop_eating_ice_cream/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1398211796.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/23os91/i_cant_stop_eating_ice_cream/", "created_utc": 1398182996.0, "ups": 5, "num_comments": 1}]
