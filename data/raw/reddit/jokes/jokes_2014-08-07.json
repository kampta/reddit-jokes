A safety team went in and found the tent to be completely safe. The remaining members of the crowd were ushered back into the tent and the old farmer was taken up to the podium and asked both who he was and how he was able to clear the smoke out of the tent so easily. He simply stated: \"I am an ex-tractor fan\".", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "There's a young farmer who really likes tractors...
