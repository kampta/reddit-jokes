The man tells St. Peter, \"I never cheated on my wife, I loved her everyday of my life.\" St. Peter then welcomes the man into Heaven and tells him because of his faithfulness he gets to drive a Rolls Royce in heaven.  \n\nSt. Peter calls the second man up and asks him if he had ever cheated on his wife.  He looks at St. Peter and says \"Well honestly, I did cheat on my wife once, and I've regretted it everyday of my life.\"  St. Peter tells him that he may go into heaven but, because he did cheat on his wife, instead of a Rolls Royce he will only receive a gas powered scooter to drive in heaven.\n\nSt. Peter calls up the final man, and asks him the same question.  The man looks at St. Peter and says, \"St. Peter, I cheated on my wife every chance i got, and I would do the same thing again.\" St. Peter looks at him and says well you were honest and therefore you may go into heaven but because of your infidelity, you will only get a bike to ride in heaven.\n\nA few days later third man is riding his bike through heaven, and he sees the first man in his Rolls Royce parked on the side of the road.
