Next time do us both a favor and keep the \"compliments\" to yourself, thanks.\n2. \u201cI\u2019m going to dinner tonight, what restaurant would you recommend?\u201d\nTHE LITERAL HELL! This one really gets under my skin. I get it okay? I can\u2019t cook, so yeah, I eat out a lot. That doesn\u2019t even begin to come close to being any of your business. And it certainly doesn\u2019t make me the top authority on local hot spots, so have some respect.\n3. \u201cAre you going to the staff meeting?\u201d\nUmm... yes. Unlike the parties that you clearly assume I\u2019m never invited to, I was in fact invited to the staff meeting. I am indeed staff.\n4. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came\u201d\nthis is nothing more than the adult equivalent of a participation ribbon.\n\n5. \u201cHow do you take your coffee\u201d\nYes, please let me give you this information so that you can take it and use it to judge me.  We all know that you only want to hear my answer so that you can tell me that I must not realllyy like coffee since I don\u2019t drink it black.  Drink your black coffee all day for all I care. Well here\u2019s a news flash for you... no one cares if you drink black coffee. It doesn\u2019t make you better than me, and I\u2019m fairly confident that hell isn\u2019t currently filled with poor souls who enjoyed a little cream in their coffee, so don\u2019t condemn me just yet my friend!\n6. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d\nThe only thing more nauseating than this question is the fake little smile on your face when you ask it.\n7. \u201cDid you do something new with your hair? There\u2019s something different about you!\u201d\nNobody uses the word \u201cdifferent\u201d in this context unless the word that they actually want to use is \u201cworse\u201d.  If you meant better you would say \u201cyou look amazing!\u201d or \u201cwow, stunning!\u201d. Here\u2019s the thing\u2026 you said neither of those things.  I will now spend the rest of the day (or week) regretting whatever decision it was I made that is clearly so awful that you felt the need to so inconsiderately comment on. \n8. \u201cCan I get the recipe for this? It\u2019s delicious!\nThis leaves me to draw one of only two conclusions: Either you honestly did like the dish, but you never want to invite me anywhere ever again where I could personally make and bring it again for you, or you\u2019re throwing me a pity card, which you may think makes you look like a great hostess but come on\u2026 you aren't Martha Stewart and you aren\u2019t fooling anyone. \n9. \u201cCan I buy you lunch\u201d \nClearly you\u2019re either hitting on me or you think that I can\u2019t afford to feed myself. I can think of absolutely no other reason why you would ask me this. \n10.  \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea!\u201d \nYou know what?! It probably was a great idea. It wouldn't be the first one that I've had and it most likely won\u2019t be the last, so don\u2019t patronize me with an over-exuberant exclamation about my thought\u2019s merit like I\u2019m your poor adopted puppy from the bad streets of Harlem or something.  And while I\u2019m on it, consider one more thing:  even if my idea was the most ridiculous thing that\u2019d you\u2019d ever heard... I wouldn't care. Even if, for the sake of argument, I\u2019d suggested that I might shave my head this weekend, dye my skin army green and quit my job to become a dolphin trainer, that would still be\u2026 wait for it\u2026 none of your business. \n\nAnd finally, now that I\u2019m good and riled up, I\u2019ve saved the most offensive for last. It is none other than:\n11. \u201cHi\u201d\nI guess the extra syllable in \u201chello\u201d would just be too much for you?  \n\n \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [],
