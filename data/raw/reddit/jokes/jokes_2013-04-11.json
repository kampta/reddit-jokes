I said, \"but sex has played a big part in my life and my life revolves around sex.\" He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everybody would like having sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the justice of peace. My family was barred from the church then on.\n\nWhen my wife and went on out honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for sex. He said every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, \"you don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night.\" The clerk said, \"me too!\"\n\nOne day I entered sex in a contest. But before the competition began, sex ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. \"You don't understand!!\" I said. \"I hoped to have sex on TV!!\". He called me a show off.\n\nWhen my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, \"your honour. I had sex before I was married, but sex left me after I was married.\" The judge said, \"me too!!\"\n\nLast night, sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her. A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning. I said, \"I'm looking for sex.\" My case comes up next Thursday.\n\nWell now I have been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw. Why just the other day when I went for my first session with my psychiatrist, she asked me, \"what seems to be the trouble?\" I replied, \"sex has been my best friend all of my life but now it has left me forever. I couldn't live any longer. So lonely.\" The doctor said, \"look mister you should understand sex isn't a man's best friend. So get yourself a dog.\"\n\n**Edit:**\n**Source**- http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-01/features/9103050771_1_dog-dear-ann-landers-motel-clerk", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A Dog Named Sex.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1c4dzv", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1c4dzv/a_dog_named_sex/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1c4dzv", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "leftanantcolonel", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1c4dzv/a_dog_named_sex/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1365692206.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1c4dzv/a_dog_named_sex/", "created_utc": 1365663406.0, "ups": 4, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>and died at the ripe old age of 38...\n                                                      Ellen Degeneris</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "and died at the ripe old age of 38...\n                                                      Ellen Degeneris\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "My gran'dad made moonshine", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1c4doh", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1c4doh/my_grandad_made_moonshine/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1c4doh", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iratam", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1c4doh/my_grandad_made_moonshine/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1365691698.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1c4doh/my_grandad_made_moonshine/", "created_utc": 1365662898.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 2}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Two men waiting at the Pearly Gates strike up a conversation. &quot;How&#39;d you die?&quot; the first man asks the second.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I froze to death,&quot; says the second.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s awful,&quot; says the first man. &quot;How does it feel to freeze to death?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s very uncomfortable at first&quot;, says the second man. &quot;You get the shakes, and you get pains in all your fingers and toes.
