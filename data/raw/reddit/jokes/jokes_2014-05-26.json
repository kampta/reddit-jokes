I came home early because I was pretty sure my wife was cheating on me. When I walked in she was naked in the back room so I knew the bastard was around. After searching for a while I couldn't find him but then I hear something out on the balcony. Now see we live in an apartment on the 3rd floor, I knew right away it was him. Sure enough I go out there to see hands hanging on the edge. I got so mad I grabbed the closest thing possible and beat his hands until he fell. Of course though the bastard falls into a patch of bushes and is *still* alive. Without thinking I grab the god damn refrigerator and throw it over the edge but when I did that I had an aneurysm and died.\"\n\nSaint Peter sits there astounded and goes \"Well OK go into heaven, that sounds like a horrible day\"\n\nOnce the first guy has left another man comes in and SP of course says \"Sit down and tell me about your day\"\n\n\"Man, I dont know man. Just I was up in my apartment doing aerobics on my balcony. I live up on the fourth floor and I slipped. I managed to grab the balcony before me but man.... some maniac came out and beat my hands until I fell. I landed in some bushes and this fucker threw a refrigerator, *a fucking refrigerator* on top of me and I died.\"\n\nSP is obviously amused at this point and says \"Go right on into heaven.\" As he leaves SP smiles, grins from ear to ear. The day was going good.\n\nThe next guy walks in and SP points to the chair containing himself. After a bit he says \"Alright tell me about your day.\"\n\nThe third guy grins ear to ear and says \"OK so picture this, I'm sitting naked in a refrigerator.\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Saint Peter Decides That Heaven Is Getting Too Full", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_26id0l", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26id0l/saint_peter_decides_that_heaven_is_getting_too/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "26id0l", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jensen36", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 370, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26id0l/saint_peter_decides_that_heaven_is_getting_too/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1401124106.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26id0l/saint_peter_decides_that_heaven_is_getting_too/", "created_utc": 1401095306.0, "ups": 370, "num_comments": 13}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The leisure centre. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "The leisure centre.
