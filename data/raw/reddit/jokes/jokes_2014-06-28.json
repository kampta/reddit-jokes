Martian alien robot one looks at a gas pump and says, \"take me to your leader.\"\nThe gas pump dosn't say anything.\nMartian alien robot one pulls out his laser gun, points it at the gas pump and says, \"take me to your leader or I'll kill you.\"\nAgain, the gas pump dosn't say anything.\nMartian alien two says to martian alien one, \"dude, hes not listening and is probably really tough. Lets move on to the next guy.\"\n\"Fuck that!\" Exclaims martian alien robot one. He then pulls out his other laser gun and points that at the gas pump as well.\n\"Take me to your leader or I'll turn you into vapor!!!\" Yells martian alien robot one.\nYet again, the gas pump dosn't say anything, so martian alien robot one pulls the triggers. The gas pump explodes, blowing both martian alien robots across the street into a vacant lot. They come to and shake it off. Martian alien robot one looks at martian alien robot two and asks, \"how did you know that guy was so tough?\"\nMartian alien robot two looks at martian robot one and answers, \"man, anybody that can wrap their dick around themselves twice and stick it their own ear is one bad motherfucker!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Two martian alien robots...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_29adi8", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/29adi8/two_martian_alien_robots/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "29adi8", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jedihooker", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/29adi8/two_martian_alien_robots/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1403946081.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/29adi8/two_martian_alien_robots/", "created_utc": 1403917281.0, "ups": 3, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Mostly because houses can&#39;t jump</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Mostly because houses can't jump", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Kangaroo can jump higher than a house", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_29ack6", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/29ack6/kangaroo_can_jump_higher_than_a_house/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "29ack6", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "abatyuk", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/29ack6/kangaroo_can_jump_higher_than_a_house/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1403945310.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/29ack6/kangaroo_can_jump_higher_than_a_house/", "created_utc": 1403916510.0, "ups": 21, "num_comments": 4}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This was my grandfather&#39;s favorite joke.
