One day he went up to the bell, rung it again then slipped off the roof and landed hard onto the asphalt, killing him instantly. Two people found him dead in the parking lot, one asked the other \" You know him?\" to which the other said \" Not really, but the face sure rings a bell.\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The Church Bell", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1mxgkl", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mxgkl/the_church_bell/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1mxgkl", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stronglove4coke", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 137, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mxgkl/the_church_bell/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1379927003.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mxgkl/the_church_bell/", "created_utc": 1379898203.0, "ups": 137, "num_comments": 11}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>An old lady walks into a store in Greece, and picks up a small slice of Feta cheese.</p>\n\n<p>She goes up to the clerk, and puts 1 Euro on the counter to pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ma&#39;am, Euros are useless.

I thought that this must be the backbone of the world, but I could find no way to cross them, and could go no further.</p>\n\n<p>Still, neither Falling Rocks nor Tall Bear had returned, and the tribe had been severely weakened without them. They could not access their hunting grounds, which were now overrun with whites, and winter was once again threatening to seize the mountains in ice. The elders of the tribe were pressuring Black Wolf to name his successor now, because they could not survive waiting around for anyone else to return. Black Wolf held out for as long as he could, every day sitting on the peak where he had issued his challenge, watching the pass for the return of his nephew. Finally, the rest of the tribe had had enough, and demanded that he name the brave who most recently returned as war chief. Just then, a lone figure staggered through the mountain pass, wrapped in buffalo skins and holding some sort of strange shell. It was Tall Bear.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I walked until I encountered another ocean. It was similar to ours, but I could tell it was also quite different. The life that inhabits it was unlike what we catch in our waters. However, I could find no way to go any further.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Black Wolf knew that he couldn&#39;t wait for Falling Rocks any longer, and named Tall Bear the new war chief, but every day he would go to the peak and watch the pass for his nephew. Eventually the cold winter air struck him with an illness that he knew he would not survive. Calling Tall Bear and the other braves to him, he told them that he still knew in his heart that Falling Rocks was still alive, and it was his dying wish to have the tribe always keep vigil for when he returns. Tall Bear and the other braves swore to never stop waiting for their brother in battle.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s why, to this day, when traveling in those mountains, you can still see signs that say &quot;Watch for Falling Rocks&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "During the days when Native Americans were being forcibly and systematically removed from their ancestral lands, a small band of Cherokee had managed to elude the U.S. cavalry by using secret refuges in the Appalachian mountains.

I could find no way to cross its muddy waters, and was forced to turn back.\"\n\nAnother month passes until another brave returns from his quest. \"I made it to vast plains, with no trees in sight. Mighty horned beasts grazed in herds beyond counting. Their hooves shook the ground like thunder. I dared not risk being lost to the anger of these creatures, and had to turn back.\n\nMonths pass, and the fifth brave returns to the tribe. \"On my travels I discovered another range of mountains. Unlike ours, these were sharp and jagged, piercing the sky with their height. I thought that this must be the backbone of the world, but I could find no way to cross them, and could go no further.\n\nStill, neither Falling Rocks nor Tall Bear had returned, and the tribe had been severely weakened without them. They could not access their hunting grounds, which were now overrun with whites, and winter was once again threatening to seize the mountains in ice. The elders of the tribe were pressuring Black Wolf to name his successor now, because they could not survive waiting around for anyone else to return. Black Wolf held out for as long as he could, every day sitting on the peak where he had issued his challenge, watching the pass for the return of his nephew. Finally, the rest of the tribe had had enough, and demanded that he name the brave who most recently returned as war chief. Just then, a lone figure staggered through the mountain pass, wrapped in buffalo skins and holding some sort of strange shell. It was Tall Bear.\n\n\"I walked until I encountered another ocean. It was similar to ours, but I could tell it was also quite different. The life that inhabits it was unlike what we catch in our waters. However, I could find no way to go any further.\"\n\nBlack Wolf knew that he couldn't wait for Falling Rocks any longer, and named Tall Bear the new war chief, but every day he would go to the peak and watch the pass for his nephew. Eventually the cold winter air struck him with an illness that he knew he would not survive. Calling Tall Bear and the other braves to him, he told them that he still knew in his heart that Falling Rocks was still alive, and it was his dying wish to have the tribe always keep vigil for when he returns. Tall Bear and the other braves swore to never stop waiting for their brother in battle.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why, to this day, when traveling in those mountains, you can still see signs that say \"Watch for Falling Rocks\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Black Wolf and his tribe (Warning Long but worth it)", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1mwfjy", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mwfjy/black_wolf_and_his_tribe_warning_long_but_worth_it/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1mwfjy", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Home_Sweet_Reddit", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 44, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mwfjy/black_wolf_and_his_tribe_warning_long_but_worth_it/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1379896766.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mwfjy/black_wolf_and_his_tribe_warning_long_but_worth_it/", "created_utc": 1379867966.0, "ups": 44, "num_comments": 9}]
