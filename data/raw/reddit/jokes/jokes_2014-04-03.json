At last she speaks.)\n\n\"Thank you, Fred,\" she says.\n\n\"Thank you,\" says Fred.\n\nThen he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Fred gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a college basketball game between two South Dakota junior colleges that he has never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it.\n\nThe next day Martha will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification.\n\nThey will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it either.\n\nMeanwhile, Fred, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Martha's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: \"Norm, did Martha ever own a horse?\"\n\nAnd that's the difference between men and women.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The Difference Between Men and Women (Long Anecdote)", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2219qk", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2219qk/the_difference_between_men_and_women_long_anecdote/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2219qk", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stone122311", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 35, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2219qk/the_difference_between_men_and_women_long_anecdote/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1396493361.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2219qk/the_difference_between_men_and_women_long_anecdote/", "created_utc": 1396464561.0, "ups": 35, "num_comments": 7}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Obama Golf!</p>\n\n<pre><code>(Receptionist) Hello, Welcome to Obama Golf .

I tried your web site, but it seems like it is not working. So I am calling the 800 number. \n\n (Receptionist) Yes, I am sorry about the web site. It should be fixed by the end of 2014. But I can help you. \n\n (Customer) Thanks, I ordered some Pro V1 balls. \n\n (Receptionist) Sir, Pro V1&#39;s do not meet our minimum standards, I will be happy to provide you with a choice of Pinnacle, TopFlite , or Callaway Blue. \n\n (Customer) But I have played Pro V1 for years. \n\n (Receptionist) The government has determined that Pro V1s are no longer acceptable, so we have instructed Titleist to stop making them.  TopFlites are better, sir, I am sure you will love them. \n\n (Customer) But I like the Pro V1.  Why are TopFlites better? \n\n (Receptionist) That is all spelled out in the 2700 page &quot;Affordable Golf Ball Act&quot; passed by Congress. \n\n (Customer) Well, how much are these TopFlites ? \n\n (Receptionist) It depends sir, do you want our Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum package? \n\n (Customer) What&#39;s the difference? \n\n (Receptionist) 12, 24, 36 or 48 balls. \n\n (Customer) The Silver package may be okay; how much is it? \n\n (Receptionist) It depends, sir; what is your monthly income? \n\n (Customer) What does that have to do with anything? \n\n (Receptionist) I need that to determine your government Golf Ball subsidy; then I can determine how much your out-of-pocket cost will be.  But if your income is below the poverty level, you might qualify for a subsidy.  In that case, I can refer you to our BallAid department. \n\n (Customer) BallAid ? \n\n (Receptionist) Yes, golf balls are a right, everyone has a right to golf balls.  So, if you can&#39;t afford them, then the government will supply them free of charge. \n\n (Customer) Who said they were a right? \n\n (Receptionist) Congress passed it, the President signed it and the Supreme Court found it Constitutional. \n\n (Customer) Whoa.....I don&#39;t remember seeing anything in the Constitution regarding golf balls as a right. \n\n (Receptionist) There&#39;s no explicit mention of golf balls in the Constitution, but President Obama is a former constitutional scholar and he believes it would have been included if the Constitutional had not been dr afted by a bunch of slave-owning white men.  The Democrats in the Congress and the Supreme Court agree with the President that golf balls are now a right guaranteed by the Constitution. \n\n(Customer) I don&#39;t believe this... \n\n(Receptionist) It&#39;s the law of the land sir. Now, we anticipated most people would go for the Silver Package, so what is your monthly income sir? \n\n(Customer) Forget it, I think I will forgo the balls this year. \n\n (Receptionist) In that case, sir, I will still need your monthly income. \n\n (Customer) Why? \n\n (Receptionist) To determine what your &#39;non-participation&#39; cost would be. \n\n (Customer) WHAT? You can&#39;t charge me for NOT buying golf balls. \n\n (Receptionist) It&#39;s the law of the land, sir, approved by the Supreme Court.

What a rip-off!! \n\n (Receptionist) Actually sir, it is a good deal. Next year it will be 2%. \n\n (Customer) Look, I&#39;m going to call my Congressman to find out what&#39;s going on here.
