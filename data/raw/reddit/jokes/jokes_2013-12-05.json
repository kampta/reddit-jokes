She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.\n\nHe proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.\n\nFor weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, \"You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels.\" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.\n\nOne o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.\n\nTwo o'clock and no hired hand.\n\nFinally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.\n\nShe quietly called him over to her..\n\n\"Unbutton my blouse and take it off,\" she said.\n\nTrembling, he did as she directed. \"Now take off my boots.\"\n\nHe did as she asked, ever so slowly.. \"Now take off my socks.\"\n\nHe removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.\n\n\"Now take off my skirt.\"\n\nHe slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. \"Now take off my bra..\" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.\n\nThen she looked at him and said, \"If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.\"", "likes": null,
