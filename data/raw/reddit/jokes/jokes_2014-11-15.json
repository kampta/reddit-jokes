She's going to get him into the club come Desert fucking Storm.   The entire time she's got him by his coat sleeves and pulling him toward the entrance, Mike cannot stop complaining and offering alternative spots. \n\n\"Hey Mike - how's it going!\" - says the Club's doorman. \n\nThe wife stops for a second.  \"Mike - have you been here before?\"\n\nMike takes a deep breath and retorts:  \"No. No.  He's just a guy who works out with me at the Gym - but let's go someplace else...\"\n\nThe wife is undettered.  Before you know it, they're giving their coats to the girl at the coat-check.   \"Hiiiii Mike\" sings the checkout girl.\n\nThe wife shoots Mike a look and does a half-smile.  \"You suuuuuure you haven't been here before?\"\n\nMike lets out a breath of exasperation.  \"She's the girl who signs people in at the gym honey.  Nothing more!\"   \n\nThe wife seems to buy it, but clearly some doubts are starting to set in. \n\nSo they get inside and sit down to enjoy the show.   The wife looks rather  intrigued by the entertainment, but Mike seems super uncomfortable.\n\nThis perfectly titted, topless little cocktail waitress comes over to take the drink orders.  \"The usual gin and tonic Mike?\"\n\nAt this point the wife starts to come unhinged.  \"Mike??  The Usual gin and tonic!?   Am I the LAST person on the planet to find out you drink and hang out in strip clubs??!!!   Tell me I'm not Mike!!\"   \n\nMike complies.  \"No you're not honey!  I mean, she's an aerobics instructor at the gym!  And...\"\n\nNow the wife is hurt and angry.  She starts to storm out of the place while Mike follows - with lame explanations.\n\nThe wife starts emoting.  \"You know, I could accept that you drink behind my back and stuff a few bucks down the g-strings of underage sluts in seedy clubs all over the city every now and again!!\" \n\n\"But DON'T lie to my fucking face like I'm a god-damned idiot!\"  \n\nMike is now profusely apologizing and trying to smooth things over.  His explanations keep getting lamer and lamer as the wife hails a cab.  She gets in.  Mike follows right in behind her. \n\nAs the wife continues her verbal assault, the cab driver starts laughing. \n\nShe turns her wrath on the poor hapless cabby.  \"You know, you can just go ahead and mind your own fucking business any time now!!!\"\n\nThe cabby smiles broadly as he looks at Mike in his rear view mirror.  \n\n\"Hell of a bitch you picked up tonight Mike.\"\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "So Mike is this straight-laced corporate workaholic...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2mb6a7", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2mb6a7/so_mike_is_this_straightlaced_corporate_workaholic/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2mb6a7", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "grixorbatz", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 418, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2mb6a7/so_mike_is_this_straightlaced_corporate_workaholic/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1416021248.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2mb6a7/so_mike_is_this_straightlaced_corporate_workaholic/", "created_utc": 1415992448.0, "ups": 418, "num_comments": 8}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I guess you could call me a wreckless driver</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "I guess you could call me a wreckless driver", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "I've been driving for about seven years and haven't had an accident yet...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2mb5id", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2mb5id/ive_been_driving_for_about_seven_years_and_havent/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2mb5id", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MPanthony2", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2mb5id/ive_been_driving_for_about_seven_years_and_havent/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1416020846.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2mb5id/ive_been_driving_for_about_seven_years_and_havent/", "created_utc": 1415992046.0, "ups": 9, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>You&#39;re riding your horse along a narrow road and to your right there&#39;s a steep cliff.
