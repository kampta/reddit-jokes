Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a county cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn't stop for directions.\n\nI finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.\n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I started to play.\n\nThe workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends.
