It goes to school with other children (obviously it's carried around by a personal carer), it joins the choir during its early teens and learns how to speak many languages. Only by the sound of it's voice do they understand this child is a boy so they name him Jack.\n\n At the age of 18, after having celebrated his birthday, his Father decides to take his son out for his first pint. They head to the pub and order a couple of beers. The father rests Jack on the bar and pops a straw in his mouth. \n\n The something amazing happens. After Jack takes a sip of the beer, a torso instantly sprouts out from beneath him. Confused but intrigued, the father tells him to take another sip. Jack does so and an arm sprouts out. Again, another arm. Twice more and he has two legs. The father cheers along with the rest of the bar. Everyone throws their hands in the air with joy as they watch Jack dance on the bar, run around the tables, sprint outside and get hit by a bus.\n\n Devastated over his sons death, the father kneels on the side of the road. Behind him, one man says to the other, \"Poor kid, I couldn't see how that could have gone wrong!\" To which the other replies, \"Yeah. Perhaps he should have quit whilst he was ahead.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Jack", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_nswnl", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/nswnl/jack/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "nswnl", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RollingThunderSkip", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/nswnl/jack/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1325059777.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/nswnl/jack/", "created_utc": 1325030977.0, "ups": 17, "num_comments": 6}]
