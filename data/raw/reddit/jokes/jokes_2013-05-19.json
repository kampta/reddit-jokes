So he uses the last ear of corn to fuck her again, and when she finishes he throws the corn out the window. The woman says that the keys to the jeep are in the ignition, and the deed and the money are in the back seat. The man runs out the door and tells the guys where the stuff is. Then the first guy says to him \"I don't know about you man, but we just had the best three pieces of buttered corn in the whole world!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Three guys are stuck in a desert", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": true, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1elz6l", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1elz6l/three_guys_are_stuck_in_a_desert/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1elz6l", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "terminator_1264", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 88, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1elz6l/three_guys_are_stuck_in_a_desert/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1368958724.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1elz6l/three_guys_are_stuck_in_a_desert/", "created_utc": 1368929924.0, "ups": 88, "num_comments": 5}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The Navy found they had too many officers and decided to offer an early retirement bonus.
