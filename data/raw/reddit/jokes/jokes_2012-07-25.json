He explains to the doctor what's going on, so the doctor decides to run the gamut of tests on him to see if they can pinpoint what's wrong.  \n\nAfter a week or so, the guy goes back in and the doctor says to him, \"Well, I've got good news and bad news.  The good news is that I was able to diagnose your problem.  The bad news is that you have a rare condition where your balls push up against the tip of your spine and cause the migraines, and the only option is castration.\"  The guy, understandably shaken says \"Whoa, no thanks doc, I think I'll be living with the headaches.\"  \n\nThe guy goes home and has a week or two of the worst headaches of his life.. He can't sleep, he's puking.  Finally at his wits end, he decides to go through with the operation.  He goes back to the doc and says, \"alright I can't live like this. It's either suicide or castration, so let's do this.\"\n\nHe goes through the operation and wakes up from surgery and the doctor sends him on his way.  Obviously the guy is super upset and depressed at having lost his manhood, so as he's driving, he decides to stop at the local Men's Warehouse to get some new clothes to maybe cheer him up a bit.\n\nHe walks in and explains to the guy working that he's depressed and wants maybe a really nice new pair of pants and shirt to brighten his spirits.  The guy looks at him and says, \"I know just the thing.  And let me see, you look like a 17/46 on the shirt, with the right arm a tad longer, and your pants are a 33/32.\"  Shocked, the guy says, \"Damn, that's exactly right.  How'd you do that?\"  The worker replies, \"Well, I've been at this so long it's like a 6th sense now.  I can look at someone and size them up perfectly.\"\n\nThe worker goes back and gets some stuff and the guy tries it on.  Impressed, he says, \"Wow, this fits perfectly and looks great.  I love it.  You've got a gift.\"  The worker replies, \"well, since we were at it, I decided to grab a few other things while I was back there in case you wanted to make it a full outfit.  I got you a jacket to go along with it and some new dress socks and boxer briefs.\"\n\nThe guy, deciding to test the worker, says, \"I'm sold, but what sizes did you get?  Let's see if you're as good as you say.\"\n\nThe worker says, \"Jacket, 42R, and like before, right arm slightly longer.  The socks, well, one size fits all.  And the briefs, size large.\"\n\nThe guy says, \"Aha!  Almost!  So close, the jacket and socks are fine, but I've always worn size medium briefs!  I'll take em anyway.\"\n\nThe worker looks him over for a minute and says, \"Oh, no, you can't wear mediums.
