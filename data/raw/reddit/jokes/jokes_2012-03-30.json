On the appointed day, he sends his son to the local brothel with the duck, telling him to give the duck to the woman there and do whatever she tells him.\n\nHe arrives at the brothel, gives the madame the duck, and is sent upstairs to a room where, to her great surprise, the lucky girl has the  most incredible sexual experience of her life.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" she exclaims. \"Can you do that again?\"\n\nThe kid isn't sure. \"I only had the one duck, and I should really get back to the farm and do my chores,\" he says.\n\n\"How about this. If I get the duck back for you, will you do that again?\"\n\nThe kid agrees and they go at it again, and it's just as good as the first time. \"Will you go to my friend's house and do the same thing to her that you just did to me?\" the girl asks. The kid agrees, so the girl goes out to the balcony and calls her friend.\n\n\"Becky,\" she says. \"I've just had the most amazing sex of my life with this farm kid. I'm sending him over to you now, you have GOT to experience this.\"\nUnbeknownst to her, Becky's boyfriend is walking by right then and overhears the whole conversation.\n\nShe takes the kid back downstairs and gets him back his duck then gives him directions to Becky's house. When he arrives, there's a man standing in front of the door.\n\n\"Excuse me, I need to get inside,\" the kid says. \n\n\"No way, kid, get lost.\"\n\nNot understanding the situation, the kid tries again. \"I really am supposed to go in there.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you something kid, that's my girlfriend in there. And you are NOT going in there. Here's $10, get lost, scram.\" And he hands him a $10 bill.\n\nThe kid shrugs, takes his duck, and heads home, where his father is waiting for him. His father is pretty surprised to see him still carrying the duck, so he asks, \"Did you go where I told you to go?\"\n\nThe kid says he did, so his father asks him, \"Well, so what happened?\"\n\nThe kid replies, \"Well, I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, ten bucks for ducking a fuck, and I've still got the fucking duck!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The farmer's son and the duck", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_rk738", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/rk738/the_farmers_son_and_the_duck/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "rk738", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "faeryjessa", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 123, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/rk738/the_farmers_son_and_the_duck/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1333098843.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/rk738/the_farmers_son_and_the_duck/", "created_utc": 1333070043.0, "ups": 123, "num_comments": 12}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>You make him run across Canada...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "You make him run across Canada...", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What's the best way to kill a one-legged fox?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_rkjs7", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/rkjs7/whats_the_best_way_to_kill_a_onelegged_fox/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "rkjs7", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gnarll", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/rkjs7/whats_the_best_way_to_kill_a_onelegged_fox/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1333115434.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/rkjs7/whats_the_best_way_to_kill_a_onelegged_fox/", "created_utc": 1333086634.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The bartender says, &quot;What the heck happend to you?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The guy says, &quot;I overheard my girlfriend talking on the phone in her &#39;sexy young girl&#39; voice to another guy.
