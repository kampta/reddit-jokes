After a long life of being disabled, at the age of 64, she decides to take a vacation to Beliz. On the first day of her vacation she&#39;s sitting in her wheelchair down by the water and starts to whimper. A local, by the name of Michael, is walking along the shore and notices the woman in distress. Michael walks over to Sally asking, &quot;is everything okay miss?&quot; \nSally, whiping a tear from her cheek, responds saying &quot;Thank you young man for caring, but no I&#39;m not okay.&quot; She informs him she&#39;s a paraplegic and tell him of the accident. &quot;As you can see I&#39;ve been stuck in this chair since I was 4 due to the accident and because of the burns on my face no man has ever loved me. I&#39;ve never even been kissed.&quot; \nBeing a nice guy, Michael says he&#39;d be more than happy to be her first kiss. He kisses her and continues on his way making Sally a very happy paraplegic. \nThe next day Sally rolls down to the same spot in hopes of seeing Michael again. To her luck, she sees him approaching in the distance, pinches herself, and works up a stream of tears. Michael takes notice and runs to her side to see what&#39;s wrong. \n&quot;Sally! What&#39;s wrong, are you okay?!&quot; he asks. \n&quot;No, I&#39;m not okay,&quot; she responds. &quot;After experiencing what a slice of intamacy felt like after you kissed me yesterday, I realized that&#39;s as far as it&#39;ll ever go for me. No man will ever want to pleasure me orally or any further,&quot; she sobs.\nIt was her lucky day. Michael, being a nice guy, makes sure the coast is clear as the sun is setting and tells Sally, &quot;You know what? I&#39;d love to be the man who does that for you.&quot; After 15 minutes of oral fixation, Sally lets out a roar of pleasure held within her for so many years. Michael licks his lips and continues on his way knowing he made someone less fortunate than himself, very happy. \nThe next few days go by and Sally rolls down to her favorite spot in hopes of seeing Michael again, but never does. It&#39;s the last day before Sally must return home and makes one last effort to see the man that has made her so happy. Right as she&#39;s about to leave the beach and set home, almost losing all hope, she sees Michael in the distance once again. She quickly jags herself in the pussy (funny enough one of the few places she still has feeling in) with a seashell in order to whip up a flood of tears. Bawling and screaming she yells out Michael&#39;s name. He hurries over to her to make sure she&#39;s okay.\n&quot;Sally! Sally! Are you okay?! What&#39;s wrong?!&quot; He asks.\nBarely being able to speak through all the pain she manages to tell him, &quot;well Michael this vacation has been great and you&#39;ve done so much for me and I&#39;ve experienced things I&#39;ve never experienced before thanks to you. However I&#39;m leaving tomorrow morning and I feel this is my last chance and you&#39;re my only hope so I&#39;m just going to come out and say it.
