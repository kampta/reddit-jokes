On Monday, all we do is sit around and drink alcohol, all day.  We have every kind of hard alcohol imaginable, hundreds of Whiskeys, Vodkas, Rums, Scotches, Tequila, mixed drinks, wines, craft beers, even crappy cheap alcohol.  We drink all day - the best part is, no hangover! You never get sick from drinking too much in Hell, it's great.\"  \n\nThe guy is starting to think that Hell is not so bad.  Satan says, \"So, were you a smoking man in life?\"\n\n\"Sure was,  I pretty much smoked until the day I died\"\n\n\"Good.  You'll like Tuesdays, on Tuesday all we do is sit around and smoke.  Cigarettes and cigars of every kind, we smoke hookah, we smoke whatever, all day long and the best part is you can never smoke too much in Hell, you don't get cancer and you don't get sick.\"\n\nSatan asks again, \"So, did you use drugs while you were alive?\" The guy says, \"Actually, I used drugs almost every day.\"  Satan goes on again, \"Well you're in luck, you will love Wednesdays, because on Wednesday we do drugs all day.  In Hell, we have every drug imaginable -uppers, downers, hallucinogens, and only the highest quality, and we sit around and do lots of drugs all day! Best part is, no overdose and no addiction in Hell.\"\n\nBy this point, the guy is starting to think that Hell sounds like a place he could get used to.  Then Satan asks him, in a quieter voice, \"By chance, in life were you a homosexual?\"\n\nThe guys responds \"No way, never, I'm as straight as it gets\"\n\nSatan grimaces and tells him \"Sorry, I don't think you're gonna like Thursdays very much.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A
