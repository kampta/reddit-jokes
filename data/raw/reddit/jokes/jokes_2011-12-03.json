each other during our &quot;cooling off&quot; period, but I couldn\u2019t wait anymore. The day you left, I swore I\u2019d never talk to you again. But that was just the wounded little boy in me talking. Still, I never wanted to be the first one to make contact. In my fantasies, it was always you who would come crawling back to me. I guess my pride needed that. But now I see that my pride\u2019s cost me a lot of things.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m tired of pretending I don\u2019t miss you. I don\u2019t care about looking bad anymore. I don\u2019t care who makes the first move as long as one of us does. Maybe it\u2019s time we let our hearts speak as loudly as our hurt and this is what my heart says: &quot;There\u2019s no one like you, Connie.&quot; I look for you in the eyes and breasts of every woman I see, but they\u2019re not you. They\u2019re not even close.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, I met this girl at Flamingos and brought her home with me. I don\u2019t say this to hurt you, but just to illustrate the depth of my desperation. She was young, maybe 19; with one of those perfect bodies that only youth and maybe a childhood spent ice skating can give you. I mean, just a perfect body. Tits like you wouldn\u2019t believe and an ass that just wouldn\u2019t quit. Every man\u2019s dream, right?</p>\n\n<p>But as I sat on the couch being blown by this stunner, I thought, look at the stuff we\u2019ve made important in our lives. It\u2019s all so superficial. What does a perfect body mean? Does it make her better in bed? Well, in this case, yes, but you see what I\u2019m getting at. Does it make her a better person? Does she have a better heart than my moderately attractive Connie? I doubt it. And I\u2019d never really thought of that before. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just growing up a little.</p>\n\n<p>Later, after I\u2019d tossed her about a half a pint of throat yogurt, I found myself thinking, &quot;Why do I feel so drained and empty?&quot; It wasn\u2019t just her flawless technique or her slutty, shameless hunger, but something else. Some nagging feeling of loss. Why did it feel so incomplete? And then it hit me. It didn\u2019t feel the same because you weren\u2019t there to watch. Do you know what I mean? Nothing feels the same without you.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus, Connie, I\u2019m just going crazy without you. And everything I do just reminds me of you. Do you remember Carol, that single mom we met at the Holiday Inn lounge last year? Well, she dropped by last week with a pan of lasagna. She said she figured I wasn\u2019t eating right without a woman around. I didn\u2019t know what she meant till later, but that\u2019s not the real story Anyway, we had a few glasses of wine and the next thing you know, we\u2019re banging away in our old bedroom.</p>\n\n<p>And this tart\u2019s a total monster in the sack. She\u2019s giving me everything, you know, like a real woman does when she\u2019s not hung up about her weight or her career and whether the kids can hear us And all of a sudden, she spots that tilting mirror on your grandmother\u2019s old vanity. So she puts it on the floor and we straddle it, right, so we can watch ourselves. And it\u2019s totally hot, but it makes me sad, too.</p>\n\n<p>Cause I can\u2019t help thinking, &quot;Why didn\u2019t Connie ever put the mirror on the floor? We\u2019ve had this old vanity for what, 14 years, and we never used it as a sex toy.&quot; Saturday, your sister drops by with my copy of the restraining order. I mean, Vicky\u2019s just a kid and all, but she\u2019s got a pretty good head on her shoulders and she\u2019s been a real friend to me during is painful time. She\u2019s given me lots of good advice about you and about women in general. She\u2019s pulling for us to get back together, Connie, she really is. So we\u2019re doing Jell-O shots in a hot bubble bath and talking about happier times. Here\u2019s this teenage girl with the same DNA as you and all I can do is think of how much she looked like you when you were 18.</p>\n\n<p>And that just about makes me cry. And then it turns out Vicky\u2019s really into the whole anal thing, that gets me to thinking about how many times I pressured you about trying it and how that probably fueled some of the bitterness between us. But do you see how even then, when I\u2019m thrusting inside your baby sister\u2019s cinnamon ring, all I can do is think of you?</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s true, Connie. In your heart you must know it.
