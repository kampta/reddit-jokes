He has been driving all night, and as the sun starts to rise, he feels the need to stop and commune with nature. He pulls to the side of the road, parks, and walks out into the sage brush.\n\nAs he is standing there, looking around at the beauty of the early morning, he notices a lever sticking out of the ground.\nAfter a few moments, he walks over, walks all the way around, and then reaches out to grasp the lever. Just as he does, he hears a voice say, \"Don't touch that lever.\"\n\nThe driver jumps about two feet off the ground, and as he comes down, he looks around. No one is to be seen. Thinking\nit was just his imagination, he again reaches for the lever. Again the voice yells, \"I said don't touch that lever!\" Being more prepared, the driver senses the location of the voice and looks down under a sage brush. There he sees a small snake.\n\nThe driver, in much astonishment, said, \"Was that you that just spoke?\"\n\nThe snake said, \"Yes. I have to keep people from touching that lever. If the lever is moved, it will be the end of the world.\"\n\nThe driver, still rather astonished, said, \"What is your name?

His dad said, &quot;Son, you did a great job this year, and as a reward, I will get you a present. What would you like?&quot;\n&quot;I want one pink ping pong ball,&quot; said the boy. His dad thought that was strange and asked why. The son said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, I&#39;ll tell you when I graduate from high school.&quot;\nThe next year, he finished first grade, and once again his dad was very proud of him. He was doing really well in math and spelling, and he had lots of friends. &quot;Son,&quot; said his dad, &quot;You had a great year. What would you like for a present?&quot; &quot;I want five pink ping pong balls,&quot; said his son. &quot;What are you going to do with all these pink ping pong balls?&quot; asked his dad. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you when I graduate,&quot; said the son.\nA few more years passed, and soon the son finished fourth grade. He got decent grades and he had started playing soccer. His dad said, &quot;Son, I&#39;m so proud of you, and I&#39;m going to get you a present. What would you like?&quot; The son said, &quot;I want 25 pink ping pong balls.&quot; His dad said, &quot;Son, I&#39;d really like to know what you are doing with all of these ping pong balls.&quot; The son said, &quot;Dad, I&#39;ll tell you when I graduate.&quot;\nA few years later, the son finished 6th grade. It was another tough transition into middle school, but he had kept his grades up and he was still playing soccer. His dad said, &quot;Son, you did a great job this year. What would you like for a present?&quot; The son said, &quot; I want 100 pink ping pong balls.&quot; &quot;Son,&quot; said the dad, exasperated, &quot;what are you doing with all of these ping pong balls?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll tell you when I graduate,&quot; he replied.\n8th grade was another good year. The son got good grades and even ran for student council. Even though he didn&#39;t win, his dad was really proud of him, and offered once again to get him a present. &quot;I want 500 pink ping pong balls,&quot; said the son. &quot;Son, please tell me what you are doing with all of these ping pong balls,&quot; said his dad. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you when I graduate high school,&quot; said his son.\nFreshman year: going to high school was tough, but still good. He ran for student council VP and won. He also made the varsity soccer team and started playing football. His dad was so proud of him. &quot;Son, you are amazing! I will get you a big present this year. What do you want?&quot; &quot;I want 1000 pink ping pong balls,&quot; said his son. &quot;Tell me what you&#39;re doing with all of these pink ping pong balls!&quot; demanded his father. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you when I graduate,&quot; said his son.\nSophomore year was another great one. He was reelected to the vice presidency, and played varsity football and soccer.

He also got perfect SAT scores, was a captain of soccer and football, was the president of his class, and was a member of every club in the school. His dad was overwhelmed. &quot;You are the best son any father could ask for. I will give you anything you want! I&#39;ll get you a car, a laptop-- anything! What do you want, son?&quot; &quot;Dad, I want 10000 pink ping pong balls,&quot; said the son. His father couldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;Son, what are you doing with all of these ping pong balls,&quot; he asked. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you next year when I graduate,&quot; he said.\nSenior year was perfect. He was the valedictorian, captain of every sports team in the school, a member of every club, and got into every college he applied to, including Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Oxford, and Cambridge. He was also very sexy. &quot;Son,&quot; said his dad, &quot;You are the greatest person on the face of the earth. It is a privilege to be your father. I will give you anything you want. Money, cars, a house-- anything you want, you name it, it&#39;s yours. I am so proud of you.&quot; &quot;Dad, I want 100,000 pink ping pong balls,&quot; said his son. &quot;Son, you&#39;re a senior now. Please tell me what you&#39;re doing will all of these ping pong balls.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll tell you tomorrow night after graduation,&quot; said his son.\nThe next day, the son was driving to graduation and was involved in a horrible car accident. The doctors told his dad that he was in very critical condition. His dad went over to his bed and told him he loved him and how proud he was. Then he asked the question that had ben plaguing him for so many years: &quot;Son,&quot; he said, &quot;I have to know.

He was also very sexy. \"Son,\" said his dad, \"You are the greatest person on the face of the earth. It is a privilege to be your father. I will give you anything you want. Money, cars, a house-- anything you want, you name it, it's yours. I am so proud of you.\" \"Dad, I want 100,000 pink ping pong balls,\" said his son. \"Son, you're a senior now. Please tell me what you're doing will all of these ping pong balls.\" \"I'll tell you tomorrow night after graduation,\" said his son.\nThe next day, the son was driving to graduation and was involved in a horrible car accident. The doctors told his dad that he was in very critical condition. His dad went over to his bed and told him he loved him and how proud he was. Then he asked the question that had ben plaguing him for so many years: \"Son,\" he said, \"I have to know. What are you doing with all of those pink ping pong balls?\"\nThe son opened his mouth to answer him... and died.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "ping pong joke", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2q0uwt", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2q0uwt/ping_pong_joke/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2q0uwt", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "akshajkadaveru", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2q0uwt/ping_pong_joke/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1419240098.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2q0uwt/ping_pong_joke/", "created_utc": 1419211298.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>11.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>One to blame men for inventing such a faulty means of illumination</p></li>\n<li><p>One to excoriate men for creating the need for illumination</p></li>\n<li><p>One to suggest the whole &quot;screwing&quot; bit to be too &quot;rape-like&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>One to deconstruct the lightbulb itself as being phallic</p></li>\n<li><p>One to blame men for not changing the bulb</p></li>\n<li><p>One to blame men for trying to change the bulb instead of letting a woman do it</p></li>\n<li><p>One to blame men for creating a society that discourages women from changing light bulbs</p></li>\n<li><p>One to blame men for creating a society where women change too many light bulbs</p></li>\n<li><p>One to advocate that lightbulb changers should have wage parity with electricians</p></li>\n<li><p>One to alert the media that women are now &quot;out-lightbulbing&quot; men</p></li>\n<li><p>One to just sit there taking pictures for her blog for photo-evidence that men are unnecessary.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "11.\n\n* One to blame men for inventing such a faulty means of illumination\n\n* One to excoriate men for creating the need for illumination\n* One to suggest the whole \"screwing\" bit to be too \"rape-like\"\n* One to deconstruct the lightbulb itself as being phallic\n* One to blame men for not changing the bulb\n* One to blame men for trying to change the bulb instead of letting a woman do it\n* One to blame men for creating a society that discourages women from changing light bulbs\n* One to blame men for creating a society where women change too many light bulbs\n* One to advocate that lightbulb changers should have wage parity with electricians\n* One to alert the media that women are now \"out-lightbulbing\" men\n* One to just sit there taking pictures for her blog for photo-evidence that men are unnecessary.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "How many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb?
