They are damn easy to follow.</p>\n\n<p>1: You CAN credit your source. If you got this joke at LOLOMGFUNNYASSJOKES.com, you can credit it with a hyperlink. You cannot, however, make a self-post and <strong>ONLY</strong> link to LOLOMGFUNNYASSJOKES.com. That defeats the purpose of this subreddit, so I won&#39;t tolerate it. Doing this will result in a warning. After 3, you will get a 1-week ban.</p>\n\n<p>1.1: Do not list your own website as the source, unless you are the <em>original</em> creator of the joke. I understand this is nearly impossible to verify and enforce, so for this we are going to go on the honor system.</p>\n\n<p>2: Do NOT use URL shorteners. Google cannot see the actual URL behind a shortened URL, so it won&#39;t count towards the websites listings. Doing this will result in a warning. After 3, you will get a 1 day ban. (There are exceptions to this rule, such as google searches using their built-in shortener, or google maps etc. But for actual websites, please link to the actual website)</p>\n\n<p>2.1: Do NOT under any circumstances use adfly, linkbucks or other &quot;paid links&quot; websites or affiliate links to generate a shortened URL that would make you money. If I see that shit (which is actually what prompted me to post this), you will <strong>instantly</strong> be banned, and it will be permanent, as you are more concerned about making money off reddit than being part of the community. This will not be tolerated at all.

They are damn easy to follow.\n\n1: You CAN credit your source. If you got this joke at LOLOMGFUNNYASSJOKES.com, you can credit it with a hyperlink. You cannot, however, make a self-post and **ONLY** link to LOLOMGFUNNYASSJOKES.com. That defeats the purpose of this subreddit, so I won't tolerate it. Doing this will result in a warning. After 3, you will get a 1-week ban.\n\n1.1: Do not list your own website as the source, unless you are the *original* creator of the joke. I understand this is nearly impossible to verify and enforce, so for this we are going to go on the honor system.\n\n2: Do NOT use URL shorteners. Google cannot see the actual URL behind a shortened URL, so it won't count towards the websites listings. Doing this will result in a warning. After 3, you will get a 1 day ban. (There are exceptions to this rule, such as google searches using their built-in shortener, or google maps etc. But for actual websites, please link to the actual website)\n\n2.1: Do NOT under any circumstances use adfly, linkbucks or other \"paid links\" websites or affiliate links to generate a shortened URL that would make you money. If I see that shit (which is actually what prompted me to post this), you will **instantly** be banned, and it will be permanent, as you are more concerned about making money off reddit than being part of the community. This will not be tolerated at all.
