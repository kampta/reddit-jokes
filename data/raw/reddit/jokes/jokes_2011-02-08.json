The original judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge&#39;s table, asking for directions to the Coors Light beer booth, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that even though I was inexperienced as a Chili taster, the chili &gt;wouldn&#39;t be all that spicy. Besides, they told me, I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the scorecard notes from the event:</p>\n\n<p>CHILI # 1 - MIKE&#39;S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI\nJudge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.\nJudge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.\nJudge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that&#39;s the worst one. These Texans are crazy.</p>\n\n<p>CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN&#39;S AFTERBURNER CHILI\nJudge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.\nJudge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\nJudge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver.

Great kick.\nJudge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.\nJudge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I&#39;ve located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I&#39;m getting {censored}-faced from all of the beer.</p>\n\n<p>CHILI # 4 - BUBBA&#39;S BLACK MAGIC\nJudge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.\nJudge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.\nJudge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds?

Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.\nJudge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage.

I crapped on myself when I farted, and I&#39;m worried it will &gt;eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can&#39;t feel my lips anymore.

I&#39;ve lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. Atleast during the autopsy, they&#39;ll know what killed me. I&#39;ve decided to stop breathing. It&#39;s too painful.
