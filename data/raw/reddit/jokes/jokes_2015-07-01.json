It's a long long way to the punchline but just bear with me.\n\nAnyways, she'd never actually seen a \"seagull\" before so she was really having trouble. In fact, because her English wasn't so great she barely knew what the term \"seagull\" meant, though she understood \"go shoot\" just fine. So she packed her guns and flew to America, where she figured she'd find a seagull one day or another.\n\nWell, she spends a good few weeks in America getting settled, seeing the sights, things like that. One day she ends up on the beach, just because you know, people go to the beach. She spends a great day on the beach, swimming, tanning, playing some volleyball with strangers, etc. After the sun sets, she's packing up and having some trouble with her umbrella. A man walks up to her and likes what he sees, starts talking her up, helping her out.\n\nThe two really hit it off well, even with the language barrier, and it's clear there's some mutual chemistry going on. Finally, the man asks her: \"So what brings you to the States?\"\n\n\"Eet eez for 'unting seagulls,\" she replies in her thick French accent. \"But I 'ave not found any.\"\n\n\"Well, bad luck with that!\" says the man. \"There were seagulls all over the beach earlier today but they're all gone now.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" murmurs the French woman, crestfallen. \"Zat eez unfortunate.
