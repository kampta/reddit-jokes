Charlie ever since he was a young boy wanted to grow up to be a streer car conductor. When he finally became old enough, he applied for the job and lo and behold he got it. Now Charlie was the friendliest street conductor that the city has ever seen. Not only did he never complain about his job, but also he greeted everyone who boarded his street car and treated them like family. Everything in his life was perfect for Charlie until one day he decided to operate the street car after having a few drinks. In his drunken state, he crashed the streetcar and killed all the passengers. After going to court Charlie was sentences to death by the eletric chair. When the day came for his execution, a gaurd visited Charlie&#39;s cell and asked him what he wanted for his final meal. Charlie replied, &quot;I want a rotten tomato and a raw fish.&quot; After Charlie finished his meal he headed into the execution room and sat down in the eletric chair. The warden gave the order to pull the switch and the room went dark as thousands of volts passed through Charlies body. After the switch was thrown back it came as a suprise that Charlie was in fact still alive. Having no idea what else to do the warden let Charlie out of jail but banned him from ever operating a streetcar in New Orleans. Since street cars were his life Charlie decided &quot;Hey I&#39;ll go to Japan, I hear they have fancy new street cars there.&quot;  In Japan Charlie gets a job as a conductor again, but as before decides that after having a few drinks that he is still able to work the street car. To no suprise Charlie crashes the stree car and kills all the passengers. Charlie again finds himself in jail ordering his last meal. &quot;A rotten tomato and a raw fish,&quot; he tells the gaurd. After the meal was eaten, Charlie was led to the chair and once again survives the eletricity. Because he wasn&#39;t dying, he was set free but banned from operating the street cars in Japan. Charlie thought to himself, &quot;Well I heard San Francisco still has street cars operating so I&#39;ll go there.&quot; As you can guess Charlie ends up in the same situation and again orders the same meal &quot; A rotten tomato and a raw fish,&quot; he tells the gaurd. The warden from San Francisco had heard of Charlie and his previous death sentences so before he brought Charlie in to be executed he sent a letter to the mayor asking to reroute the city&#39;s eletricity to the jail. The mayor approved and confident with his new found power the warden smiled and gave the order to pull the switch. The lights in the room burst from the overload and the smell of something burning overwelmed the air. The warden after a minute ordered the gaurd to shut off the chair and as the smoke cleared, there was Charlie same as always. Distraught with emotion, the warden told Charlie to get out of his sights. Charlie, tired of going to jail, finally decided that maybe he shouldn&#39;t be a street car conductor after all. So Charlie travels back to New Orleans and meets his friend Thibodaux at a bar.  Thibodaux after a few minutes of small talk tells Charlie &quot;Everyone has heard about the eletric chair incidents and I just gotta axe, how were you able to survive all them jolts of electricity through your body? Was there something you did that made you resistant to it?&quot; Charlie looks at Thibodaux and says &quot;I dunno, I guess I was just a bad conductor.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Long joke that is passed down in my family\n\n So down in New Orleans there lived a man named Charlie.

The interviewer asks him \"Do you love your wife?\" so he replies \"Yes I do, sir.\" \"Do you love your country?\" asks the interviewer. \"Yes I do, sir.\", interviewer continues, \"What do you love more, your wife or your country?\" he replies \"My country, sir.\" The interviewer looks at the man, \"Okay. We brought in your wife. Take this gun and go into the next room and kill her.\"\n\nThe man goes into the room, and all is silent for about 5 minutes. He comes back, with his tie loosened and he is all sweaty. He puts down the gun and leaves. The second guy comes in and sits down. The interviewer asks him the same questions, and the responses are the same. The interviewer gives him a gun, and tells him to go kill his wife. The guy puts the gun down and says \"I can't do it...\"\n\nThe third guy comes in, the same thing happens. The interviewer gives him a gun, and tells him to go kill his wife. The guy goes into the room, and they hear a bunch of crashing sounds that end after a few minutes. The guy comes out of the room with his tie loosened, and puts the gun on the table. The interviewer looks at him and says \"What happened?!?!\", to which the guy replies, \"The gun you gave me was empty so I had to strangle her!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "An FBI Interview", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1txbr3", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1txbr3/an_fbi_interview/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1txbr3", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "omailnumber1", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1txbr3/an_fbi_interview/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1388324313.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1txbr3/an_fbi_interview/", "created_utc": 1388295513.0, "ups": 14, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>&quot;My dick just died...
