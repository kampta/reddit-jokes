When I get groceries 'Tyrone help bring in the bags' and 5 Tyrones get it all inside and put away real quick!\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" replied the reporter, \"but what if you need a specific son?\" The woman laughed and said, \"Oh that's easy, just call 'em by their last name.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The seven sons", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2f7ahz", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2f7ahz/the_seven_sons/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2f7ahz", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Trejio", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2f7ahz/the_seven_sons/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1409636769.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2f7ahz/the_seven_sons/", "created_utc": 1409607969.0, "ups": 18, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sits down and works it out with a pencil.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Sits down and works it out with a pencil.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What does a mathematician do about constipation?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2f77u3", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2f77u3/what_does_a_mathematician_do_about_constipation/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2f77u3", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "secondchimp", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 47, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2f77u3/what_does_a_mathematician_do_about_constipation/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1409635281.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2f77u3/what_does_a_mathematician_do_about_constipation/", "created_utc": 1409606481.0, "ups": 47, "num_comments": 6}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>He had no attachments. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "He had no attachments.
