So the next day, the king granted his son the solitary pink ping-pong ball and the son took it with him to his room. He was in there for a few minutes, and after that, the pink ping-pong ball was never seen again. The king respected his son, so he didn&#39;t pry into his private life, but he was still very curious as to what the son did.</p>\n\n<p>The night before the son&#39;s 17th birthday, the king asked his son what he wanted. The son said: &quot;Father, all I could want for my birthday is a 10-pack of pink ping-pong balls.&quot; The king is shocked again, but the next day the son got what he wished for, before going to his room for an hour with the pack.

The son said: &quot;Father, all I could want for my birthday is a shack full of pink ping-pong balls.&quot; The next day, the son got his shack filled to the brim with pink ping-pong balls, and he disappears to his room for a full day.

The son said: &quot;Father, all I could ever want for my birthday is a ware-house full of pink ping-pong balls.&quot; The king, unsurprised, accepted. The next day, the son got his warehouse of pink ping-pong balls, and he stayed there for a few days. When he returned, not one pink ping-pong ball was ever seen again. The king fought his bursting curiosity and didn&#39;t question his son.</p>\n\n<p>However, the night before the son&#39;s 21st birthday, the prince got into a horrible car accident. He was in the hospital, on his death-bed, when his father visited him. &quot;Son,&quot; he said, &quot;this is going to be your last birthday for us together.

Forgive me for intruding on your privacy, but if I don&#39;t know, I will surely die of suspense. Son, why do you ask for pink ping-pong balls when you can have anything in the world? Why did you ask for more pink ping-pong balls every year? And what in God&#39;s name are you doing with them?&quot; The son opened his mouth to explain, but he knew he was too weak, so he whispered: &quot;I&#39;ll explain everything tomorrow when I have my energy, just get me the pink ping-pong ball.&quot; With that, the son passed out, and the king stayed with him all night.</p>\n\n<p>The next morning, the king gave the son his pink ping-pong ball, then left him alone for a few minutes. When he came back, the pink ping-pong ball was gone. &quot;Son, now will you tell me your secret about your pink ping-pong balls?&quot; The son nodded. &quot;I shall tell you why I asked for pink ping-pong balls. I shall tell you why I asked for more every year. And I shall tell you what I did with them every year... Just... Lean closer...&quot; The king leaned forward and gave the son his ear.

He expected a car, since he was getting his license the next day, but the son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a pink ping-pong ball.\" The king thinks he's joking at first, but the son swears he wasn't. So the next day, the king granted his son the solitary pink ping-pong ball and the son took it with him to his room. He was in there for a few minutes, and after that, the pink ping-pong ball was never seen again. The king respected his son, so he didn't pry into his private life, but he was still very curious as to what the son did.\n\nThe night before the son's 17th birthday, the king asked his son what he wanted. The son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a 10-pack of pink ping-pong balls.\" The king is shocked again, but the next day the son got what he wished for, before going to his room for an hour with the pack. When he got out, the pink ping-pong balls were never seen again, and the king never asked where they went.\n\nThe night before the son's 18th birthday, the king asked his son what he wanted. The king was excited to buy him his own castle for him to live in, but instead the son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a crate full of pink ping-pong balls.\" The king, albeit disappointed, gives his son the crate of pink ping-pong balls the following day. The son went to his room for a few hours, and when he came out, the pink ping-pong balls were never seen again. The king didn't ask what he did with them.\n\nThe night before the son's 19th birthday, the king asked him what he wanted. He was expecting it by now. The son said: \"Father, all I could want for my birthday is a shack full of pink ping-pong balls.\" The next day, the son got his shack filled to the brim with pink ping-pong balls, and he disappears to his room for a full day. The pink ping-pong balls were never seen again. The king did not ask the son what he did with them.\n\nThe night before the son's 20th birthday, the king asked him what we wanted. The son said: \"Father, all I could ever want for my birthday is a ware-house full of pink ping-pong balls.\" The king, unsurprised, accepted. The next day, the son got his warehouse of pink ping-pong balls, and he stayed there for a few days. When he returned, not one pink ping-pong ball was ever seen again. The king fought his bursting curiosity and didn't question his son.\n\nHowever, the night before the son's 21st birthday, the prince got into a horrible car accident. He was in the hospital, on his death-bed, when his father visited him. \"Son,\" he said, \"this is going to be your last birthday for us together. Ask for anything, and you shall receive.\" The king was prepared to buy the son the moon and all of the stars if that's what he wanted, but instead the son croaked: \"Father... A-all I could want... Is... Is a pink... Ping... Pong... Ball...\" The king, with tears in his eyes, begged: \"My sweet son, my darling child, my first-born and only child... Forgive me for intruding on your privacy, but if I don't know, I will surely die of suspense. Son, why do you ask for pink ping-pong balls when you can have anything in the world? Why did you ask for more pink ping-pong balls every year? And what in God's name are you doing with them?\" The son opened his mouth to explain, but he knew he was too weak, so he whispered: \"I'll explain everything tomorrow when I have my energy, just get me the pink ping-pong ball.\" With that, the son passed out, and the king stayed with him all night.\n\nThe next morning, the king gave the son his pink ping-pong ball, then left him alone for a few minutes. When he came back, the pink ping-pong ball was gone. \"Son, now will you tell me your secret about your pink ping-pong balls?\" The son nodded. \"I shall tell you why I asked for pink ping-pong balls. I shall tell you why I asked for more every year. And I shall tell you what I did with them every year... Just... Lean closer...\" The king leaned forward and gave the son his ear. The son sat-up and croaked: \"I-\" he gasped for air, \"I-\" he gasped again, \"I-\" the son took his last breath and died.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "There was once a king who would do anything for his children...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2bx1pa", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bx1pa/there_was_once_a_king_who_would_do_anything_for/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2bx1pa", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "leafkid", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bx1pa/there_was_once_a_king_who_would_do_anything_for/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1406551171.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bx1pa/there_was_once_a_king_who_would_do_anything_for/", "created_utc": 1406522371.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 7}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>one turns to the other and says &quot;NOPE!&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "one turns to the other and says \"NOPE!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Two fish are STILL in a tank", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2bx1ht", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bx1ht/two_fish_are_still_in_a_tank/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2bx1ht", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "realityisoverrated", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bx1ht/two_fish_are_still_in_a_tank/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1406551007.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bx1ht/two_fish_are_still_in_a_tank/", "created_utc": 1406522207.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Pandas.

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.</p>\n\n<p>So the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up withgeese.</p>\n\n<p>So the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inchpianist?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the bartender is understandably ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inchpianist?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry.

It\u2019s on me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "By Simon Rich ( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/guy-walks-into-a-bar?src=mp)\n\nSo a guy walks into a bar one day and he can\u2019t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\n\nSo the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d\n\nSo the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up withgeese.\n\nSo the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inchpianist?\u201d\n\nSo the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d\n\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\n\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d\n\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d\n\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inchpianist?\u201d\n\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.\n\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean\u00a0that.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it.
