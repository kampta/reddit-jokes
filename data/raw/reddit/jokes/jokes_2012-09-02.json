That guy down at the end of the bar \ncalls his SNICKERS, because 'It really Satisfies.' \n\nThe cowboy looks dumbfounded, so the bartender tells him he will give \nhim a second to think it over. \n\nThe cowboy asks the man sitting to his left who is sipping on \na beer, 'Hey bud, what's the name of yours?' The man looks back and says \nwith a smile, 'TIMEX.' The thirsty cowboy asks, 'Why Timex?' The fella \nproudly replies, ' 'Cause it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin!'' \n\nA little shaken, the cowboy turns to two fella's on his right, who happen to \nbe sharing a fruity Margarita and says, 'So, what do you guys call yours?' \nThe first man turns to him and proudly exclaims, 'FORD', because \n''Quality is Job One.' Then he adds, 'Have you driven a Ford lately?' \n\nThe guy next to him then says, 'I call mine CHEVY, 'Like a Rock!' And gives a \nwink! Even more shaken, the Cowboy has to think for a moment before he \ncomes up with a name for his manhood. \n\nFinally, he turns to the bartender \nand exclaims, 'The name of my 'willy' is SECRET. Now give me a beer.' \n\nThe bartender begins to pour the cowboy a beer, but with a puzzled look asks, \n'Why Secret?' The cowboy says, 'Because it's 'STRONG ENOUGH FOR A MAN, \nBUT MADE FOR A WOMAN!!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A cowboy", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_z6vrs", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/z6vrs/a_cowboy/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "z6vrs", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kojak343", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 157, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/z6vrs/a_cowboy/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1346548728.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/z6vrs/a_cowboy/", "created_utc": 1346519928.0, "ups": 157, "num_comments": 11}]
