The bear is shocked that the rabbit is asking for such idiotic items, because after all, he could have asked for money and bought the bike. \n\nFor the last wish the bear thought for a while and then said, \"I wish that all the bears in the world, apart from me, are female.\" \n\nThe rabbit grinned, roared the engine, and said, \"I wish that this bear is gay.\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "One day, down in the mystical forest, a magical frog is hopping towards a water hole...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1jqfro", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jqfro/one_day_down_in_the_mystical_forest_a_magical/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1jqfro", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "arceus_n_luxray", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jqfro/one_day_down_in_the_mystical_forest_a_magical/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1375730493.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jqfro/one_day_down_in_the_mystical_forest_a_magical/", "created_utc": 1375701693.0, "ups": 16, "num_comments": 6}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>1.\nA hippie walks into a bus and sees a very sexy nun.
