She is hesitant at first but after the boyfriend's constant reminders that they're alone in the desert she gives in and strips naked. \"See,\" says the boyfriend, \"it's just you and me, baby.\" The boyfriend starts having a bit of trouble keeping his eyes on the road and loses control of the car. They swerve left and right and suddenly the convertible flips. The woman is tossed out of the vehicle while the boyfriend remains stuck under the flipped car on the side of the road. The only part of the boyfriend that is visible is his feet sticking out from under the car. \nNaked and afraid, the woman realizes she will have to go get help. She grabs the boyfriend's shoes and covers her vagina with them. After a few hours of walking she finally comes across a gas station. She hobbles into the station and gets the clerk's attention. \"Help!
