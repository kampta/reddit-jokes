After each lesson, I want you to show me what you've learned. I want to see that you can commit to practicing.\"\n\nLittle Bobby agreed, and they went to the store and purchased a bass, amp and cable and found a flier for a local bass instructor. Saturday morning, Little Bobby packed up his bass and went off to his first lesson.\n\nUpon returning home, Papa Tavoli stopped him and asked, \"What did you learn at your lesson this week?\"\n\nLittle Bobby removed his bass from his gig-bag and said, \"I learned the E string.\" He plucked the lowest string a few times and said \"E. E. E.\"\n\nPapa Tavoli, pleased with the results sent Little Bobby off to practice for his next lesson.\n\nThe following Saturday, Little Bobby scurried off eagerly to meet with his instructor. Again, as he walked in the door, his father stopped him and asked Little Bobby to show him what he had learned.\n\nLittle Bobby once again removed his bass from the gig-bag and said, \"This week we learned quarter notes.\" He plucked the E string four times, keeping fairly good time and saying \"1. 2. 3. 4.\"\n\nExcited about his son's progress, Papa Tavoli patted Little Bobby on the back and sent him to continue his studies.\n\nOn the third Saturday, Little Bobby was up early practicing his E string and quarter notes and then left for his lesson without so much as a goodbye. When he returned an hour later, Papa Tavoli stopped him again, and said \"Little Bobby, show me what you...\"\n\nBut Little Bobby interrupted him and said, \"Sorry Dad, no time to talk. I've got a gig, gotta go.\"\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "title": "Learning to play the
