He says,\n\"My good man, thank you for freeing me from this lamp. As a token of my gratitude, you can have three wishes from me.\"\n\nThe man is elated. \"I wish I could have a Ferrari!\" The genie snaps his fingers and a shiny red Ferrari materializes in front of him. The man, delighted by his lucky turn in life, excitedly says, \"I wish to be a billionaire!\" The genie once again makes it so.\n\nThe man, now decked in the finest suit money could buy (inevitably to be coated with sand anyway), scans the secluded beach and says, \"Genie, you have given me everything I ever wanted. But one thing I'd like is a road connecting California to Hawaii.\"\n\nThe genie looks dismayed. \"Look man, that's really difficult for me to do. That's like 2000 miles, plus there's the water to deal with, so it would be almost impossible. Is there anything else you might want?\"\n\nJust then, a beautiful woman comes strolling down the beach in the opposite direction. The man quickly turns to the genie before she comes closer and says, \"I have never been good with the opposite sex. Make me understand women! Help me understand exactly what goes on in their heads, what really makes them tick. All the money and Ferraris in the world could not make me any better at that. Yes, that's what I want.\"\n\nThe genie thinks about it for a moment, then asks, \"Do you want two lanes or four?\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A man walks along a beach in Hawaii when he finds a lamp.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_26zy2m", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26zy2m/a_man_walks_along_a_beach_in_hawaii_when_he_finds/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "26zy2m", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deltaairlines95", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 140, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26zy2m/a_man_walks_along_a_beach_in_hawaii_when_he_finds/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1401614226.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/26zy2m/a_man_walks_along_a_beach_in_hawaii_when_he_finds/", "created_utc": 1401585426.0, "ups": 140, "num_comments": 5}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The first guy has the parachutes and gives both of them to the others, the second guy says thank you and jumps.
