During the Spring, I was running low on money and asked around for a job. As luck would have it, a local shepherd said he needed help with his flock for the summer. I got to sleep in the barn, and I got fed three square meals a day. It was awesome. After a few weeks, the shepherd asked me to round up the flock and head out into the countryside, far from town and his ranch. We camped out under the stars, it was warm at night, and I ate like a king. Then one day the shepherd said he needed to go back into town for a bit and would I mind tending the flock for a week alone? I was pretty comfortable with the job at this point, so I agreed.
