That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner.\n\nAfter dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, \"I am so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?\"\n\nBill thought for a while and said, \"I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.\"\n\nHillary was shocked, but said, \"Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I am very disappointed and saddened by your behavior. However, since you are addicted to sex I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.\"\n\nBill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, \"So why do you have all that money in the box?\"\n\nBill answered: \"Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Bill & Hillary [x-post from

The lizard looks up and says to the monkey \u201cHey! what are you doing?\u201d The monkey says \u201cSmoking a joint, come up and join me, my cold-blooded friend.\u201d\n\nSo the lizard climbs up and sits next to the monkey and they have another joint. After a while the lizard says his mouth is \u2018dry\u2019, and that he\u2019s going to get a drink from the river.\n\nAt the riverbank, the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to the side.\n\nHe then asks the lizard, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?!\u201d The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree, smoking a joint with his new monkey friend. He then explained how his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in!\n\nThe inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint. He looks up and says \u201cHey, MONKEY!\u201d The Monkey looks down and says \u201cFUUUUUCK, DUDE\u2026\u2026. how much water did you drink?\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A monkey is sitting in a tree, smoking a joint...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1a206s", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1a206s/a_monkey_is_sitting_in_a_tree_smoking_a_joint/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1a206s", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rx_pickle", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 299, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1a206s/a_monkey_is_sitting_in_a_tree_smoking_a_joint/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1362994148.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1a206s/a_monkey_is_sitting_in_a_tree_smoking_a_joint/", "created_utc": 1362965348.0, "ups": 299, "num_comments": 12}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>...while he&#39;s walking down the shore he sees a 20-year old, blonde-haired girl sitting in the sand crying.
