No, they don't.\"\n\n\nThe man agreed with the bartender as he watched him make his way to the taps. As the bartender begins filling up the man's tankard, he asks again:\n\n\n\"You see this pub, boy?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, a fine pub. A very, very fine pub indeed. The architect did a marvelous job.\"\n\n\nThe bartender, slaps his chest and scowls:\n\n\n\"**I built this pub, boy!** But \u2018cha build one good pub, the don't call you *'Bob the Pub-Builder'*, do they? *Noooooo*, no they don't. No, they don't.\"\n\n\nAgain, the man reluctantly agreed, not wanting to upset the bartender.\n\n\nFinally, the bartender finishes up with the tankard of stout, clears the foamy-head from it, and hands it over to the man. The man, after a couple of swigs, is once again questioned by the bartender, who\u2019s eyebrows have furrowed viciously.\n\n\n\"You enjoying that stout there, boy?\"\n\n\n\"Actually, yes!\u201d the man replies, \u201cIt is a finely crafted drink. Hell, I might even go as far as say it rivals Guinness!\"\n\n\nThe bartender, slaps his chest once more..\n\n\n\"**I crafted that stout there, boy.** But cha\u2019 brew one good stout, they don't call you \"*Bob the Stout-Brewer*\"! *Noooooo*, no they don't.\u201d\n\n\nThe bartender than drops his head into his hands, and starts weeping heavily. However, before the man could get a word in, he yells out:\n\n\n\u201c**But \u2018cha fuck one goat!**\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "An Irishman, stricken with severe insomnia, decides he needs go for a late night walk..
