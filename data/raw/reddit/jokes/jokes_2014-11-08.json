As the President has pointed out, two-thirds of registered voters didn&#39;t vote. Their silence can be taken as strong evidence of their satisfaction with the way things are going. They had every opportunity to go out and vote against the President&#39;s policies, but they didn&#39;t.

While my opponent was treating a handful of individual victims I was addressing the bigger problem\u2014the incompetence of the Bush Administration.

It could hardly be more clear that Bill Cassidy is a man of action and a person with a heart. He saw a need and took steps to meet it.

It plans to bulldoze it and sell the land to a private grocery chain. Despite renovating a dilapidated warehouse and converting it into an attractive and bustling center for artistic expression, Dupree&#39;s property rights are being sacrificed to the PRA&#39;s vision of what the City needs.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s a question of whether the rights of the collective community should take precedence over the rights of a single individual,&quot; PRA Executive Director Ed Covington explained. &quot;Far more people will eat the food sold at the proposed supermarket than will ever see the works of art produced or displayed at Mr. Dupree&#39;s studio. Social justice commands that the benefit of the greater number takes precedence over the rights of one man.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Covington dismissed the possibility that the supermarket could be built at another location. &quot;I suppose that if we were to search hard enough we might find such a place, but it might not be as conveniently located,&quot; he said. &quot;Should we really undermine the convenience of thousands of shoppers in the name of the abstract property rights of a single individual?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>IRS Admits It Didn&#39;t Really Look for Lois Lerner&#39;s &quot;Lost&quot; Emails</p>\n\n<p>IRS Commissioner John Koskinen admitted that it didn&#39;t exercise much effort to track down emails cited in an investigation of IRS abuses involving harassment of conservative political organizations.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Look, we were between a rock and a hard place,&quot; Koskinen contended. &quot;On the one hand, we have Congress and the Courts demanding we produce these documents.

He told her that he would be working late, and he knows that she goes to bed early and is a heavy sleeper. \n\n\nSo he enjoys his night, but finally the night comes to an end, and it's time for him to go home. He makes sure to close his tab, checks to ensure he has his id and wallet - he does. Knowing that all of his bases are covered he goes to get up to leave and falls flat on his face. \n\n\nHe's a little drunk, so not entirely surprised. So he tries to get up and walk with the same results - bam, flat on his face. Now he's lying on the floor thinking, \"Shit. I can't call my wife, she will have my ass if she found out I was lying about working so I could go drink tonight.\"\n\n\nBut he's a determined man. He decides if he can't walk, then damnit, he'll fucking crawl. And crawl he does. He crawls the full mile from the bar to his house. By some miracle, he is able to unlock his door and lock it again once he's inside. And by an even bigger miracle, he's able to crawl his way into his bedroom and into bed without waking his wife. The man goes to bed smugly thinking how goddamn smooth he is.\n\n\nThe next morning, he wakes up with his wife standing over him glaring at him with the fury of a thousand hells.\n\n\n\"So... you went to the bar last night, eh?\" The wife angrily asks.\n\n\n\"What are you talking about, I was working?\" The man replies. In his mind, he's going back over his night. He is positive he covered all of his bases. There's no way his wife could have known.\n\n\n\"Don't lie to me; I know the truth.\" The wife snaps back.\n\n\n\"How?\" The man asks, generally stumped as to how she could possibly know.\n\n\n\"The bartender called... you left your wheelchair at the bar!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false,
