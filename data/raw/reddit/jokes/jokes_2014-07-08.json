ten?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And God saw it was good.</p>\n\n<p>On the second day, God created the monkey and said,\n&quot;Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh.\nFor this, I&#39;ll give you a twenty-year life span.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The monkey said, &quot;Monkey tricks for twenty years?\nThat&#39;s a pretty long time to perform.\nHow about I give you back ten like the dog
