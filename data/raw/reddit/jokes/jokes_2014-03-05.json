Where did you come by\nthis kind of money?\"  \n The old lady coyly replied, \"I make bets.\"\n Surprised, the president then asked, \"Bets?  What kind of bets?\" \n The old woman said, \"Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that\nyour balls are square.\"\n \"What?!\" cried the man, \"you want to bet me $25,000 that my balls,\nmy testicles, are square?\" He could hardly hold back from laughing.\n \"Yes, you heard me.  In fact, by ten o'clock tomorrow morning,\nI'll bet you $25,000 that your balls will be square.\"\n The man smiled broadly, thinking he had a live one.  \"You've got\nyourself a bet!\" and shook her hand. The little old lady then said, \"Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. as a witness?\" \"Sure!\" replied the confident president.That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again.  He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were\nsquare and that he would win the bet. The next morning, at precisely 10:00 a.m., the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office.  She introduced\nthe lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: \"$25,000 says\nthe president's balls are square!\" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see.  The president complied.\nThe little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. \"Well, Okay,\" said the president, obviously embarrassed. Thinking to himself, \"$25,000 is a lot of money, I guess it's okay.\" He then said, \"Yes, $25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.\" As the old woman started to feel the banker's testicles, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall.The president asked the old lady, \"What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?\"\nThe old lady replied, \"Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that\nat 10:00 a.m. today, I'd have the balls of the president of the Bank of America in my hands.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The Old Lady who makes Bets", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1zjcs1", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1zjcs1/the_old_lady_who_makes_bets/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1zjcs1", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ImJoeAF_", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 113, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1zjcs1/the_old_lady_who_makes_bets/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1393977728.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1zjcs1/the_old_lady_who_makes_bets/", "created_utc": 1393948928.0, "ups": 113, "num_comments": 9}]
