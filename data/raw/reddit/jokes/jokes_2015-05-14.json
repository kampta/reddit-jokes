Well, here is a story that shows not all cops are in that category.\n\nThe Joplin , Missouri Police Department reported finding a man's body last Saturday in the Spring River near the Empire Electric Plant. The police would not release the dead man's name until his family had been notified.\n\nThe victim apparently drowned due to excessive beer consumption while visiting \"someone\" in Riverton , Kansas. He was wearing black fishnet stockings, nipple rings, a red garter belt, a pink G-string, purple lipstick, and an Obama T-shirt.\n\nThe police removed the Obama T-shirt to spare the man's family any unnecessary embarrassment.\n\nPolice Do Care.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Police do care!", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_35ybs4", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35ybs4/police_do_care/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "35ybs4", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bushwacker61", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35ybs4/police_do_care/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1431645144.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35ybs4/police_do_care/", "created_utc": 1431616344.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Unidank</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Unidank", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What do you call a person who uses multiple accounts to upvote their own memes?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_35yavk", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35yavk/what_do_you_call_a_person_who_uses_multiple/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "35yavk", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CoolJoe16", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35yavk/what_do_you_call_a_person_who_uses_multiple/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1431644734.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/35yavk/what_do_you_call_a_person_who_uses_multiple/", "created_utc": 1431615934.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>You&#39;re walking down a \ndeserted street with your wife \nand two small children.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, a Terrorist with a huge knife \ncomes around the corner,<br/>\nlocks eyes with you,\nscreams obscenities,<br/>\nraises the knife, and charges at you... </p>\n\n<p>You are carrying  a \nKimber 1911 cal. 45 ACP, and you are an expert shot.<br/>\nYou have mere seconds before he reaches you and your  family. \nWhat do you do?   </p>\n\n<p>THINK  CAREFULLY AND<br/>\nTHEN SCROLL  DOWN: </p>\n\n<p>Democrat&#39;s Answer: </p>\n\n<p>Well, that&#39;s not enough information to answer the question! \nWhat is a Kimber 1911 cal. 45 ACP? \nDoes the man look poor or oppressed? \nIs he really a terrorist?
