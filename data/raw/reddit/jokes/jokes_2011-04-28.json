Amusing kick. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that&#39;s the worst one. These Texans are crazy. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>CHILI 2 - AUSTIN &#39;S AFTERBURNER CHILI</p>\n\n<p>Judge 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>CHILI 3 - FRED&#39;S BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI</p>\n\n<p>Judge 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 3 -- Call the EPA. I&#39;ve located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I&#39;m getting drunk from all of the beer. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>CHILI 4 - BUBBA&#39;S BLACK MAGIC</p>\n\n<p>Judge 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice.

Good side dish for fish or other mild foods not much of a chili. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds?

Very impressive. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I&#39;m burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>CHILI 6 - VERA&#39;S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY</p>\n\n<p>Judge 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I pooped on myself when I farted and I&#39;m worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can&#39;t feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my rearend with a snow cone. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>CHILI 7 - SUSAN&#39;S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI</p>\n\n<p>Judge 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. </p>\n\n<p>Judge 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about Judge 3.
