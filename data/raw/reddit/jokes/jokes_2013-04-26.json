Thibodeaux looks at him, and asks \"what you doing with a boat full of duct tape?\" Boudreaux replies \"I'm going duck hunting! You wanna come?\" \"You can't hunt ducks with duct tape, and no I ain't coming\" replied Thibodeaux.  So Boudreaux leaves.  Later in the day Thibodeaux sees Boudreaux fly by in his boat, and low and behold its full of ducks. \"Well i'll be damned!\" says Thibodeaux.\n\nThe next morning as Thibodeaux is enjoying the sunrise, Boudreaux pulls up in his boat again, this time with a boat full of gatorade.  Sarcastically Thibodeaux says \"Let me guess, you gonna catch gators with gatorade?\" \"Yep, you wanna come?\" says Boudreaux. \"You can't catch gators with gatorade...No I ain't coming!\" So Boudreaux leaves. Later that day Thibodeaux sees Boudreaux fly by in his boat, and it was filled with gators. \"Well i'll be damned!\" says Thibodeaux.\n\nThe next morning as Thibodeaux is enjoying the sunrise, Boudreaux pulls up in his boat agian...this time with a boat full of pussy willows.  Thibodeaux thinks for a second and says...\"Hold on let me get my hat\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked":
