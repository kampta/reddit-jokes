Also, my english is bad, so apologies for that in advance.</em></p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, there was this small town which somehow had a circus. It was nothing special until one day, when people woke up to advertisments everywhere going &quot;Awesome show!&quot;, &quot;Unique performance!&quot;, &quot;Something you&#39;ve never seen in your life!&quot;, &quot;Once in a lifetime event!&quot;. Needless to say, people were intrigued and the place was packed on this date. It was a quite large arena. People would come in, take a seat and everyone got a note saying to remain dead quiet during the show, to turn off all the cellphones and other stuff. </p>\n\n<p>So the time comes, everyone&#39;s sitting in total silence and everything&#39;s dark to the point where you can&#39;t see your neighbour. There&#39;s only one small chair with a lamp on the stage. Five minutes pass and nothing is going on, but then a small man appears, takes a seat on this chair, looks around, sees noone and starts jerking off furiously.</p>\n\n<p>Five minutes pass, he&#39;s still masturbating, ten minutes pass... Twenty minutes pass and everyone&#39;s still dead quiet. Thirty minutes pass and this guy is still doing his stuff!</p>\n\n<p>Out of nowhere, an angered man rises from his seat and yells: &quot;When will this end already!?&quot; and the frightened small guy says: &quot;Ah! Who&#39;s here!?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT: Comments are better than the joke itself. Also people take jokes too seriously.

Also, my english is bad, so apologies for that in advance.*\n\nOnce upon a time, there was this small town which somehow had a circus. It was nothing special until one day, when people woke up to advertisments everywhere going \"Awesome show!\", \"Unique performance!\", \"Something you've never seen in your life!\", \"Once in a lifetime event!\". Needless to say, people were intrigued and the place was packed on this date. It was a quite large arena. People would come in, take a seat and everyone got a note saying to remain dead quiet during the show, to turn off all the cellphones and other stuff. \n\nSo the time comes, everyone's sitting in total silence and everything's dark to the point where you can't see your neighbour. There's only one small chair with a lamp on the stage. Five minutes pass and nothing is going on, but then a small man appears, takes a seat on this chair, looks around, sees noone and starts jerking off furiously.\n\nFive minutes pass, he's still masturbating, ten minutes pass... Twenty minutes pass and everyone's still dead quiet. Thirty minutes pass and this guy is still doing his stuff!\n\nOut of nowhere, an angered man rises from his seat and yells: \"When will this end already!?\" and the frightened small guy says: \"Ah! Who's here!?\".\n\n*EDIT: Comments are better than the joke itself. Also people take jokes too seriously.
