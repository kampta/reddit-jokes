In an effort to impress the young woman Frank spared no expense: he hired a driver, wore his best suit, and managed to get reservations at one of the hottest restaurants in town. Despite these efforts Amanda did not seem impressed.\n\nHalfway through their dinner at the four-star establishment it became clear to Frank that Amanda was simply out of his league. Worse, she seemed to know it. It was a pity date, nothing more. Dejected, Frank excused himself to go use the restroom. On his way back to his table, however, he noticed none other than actress Scarlett Johansson sitting at a table with a group of friends. That gave him an idea.\n\n\"Ms. Johansson?\" he said to the beautiful star of *Lost in Translation* and *The Avengers*. \"I hate to bother you but I was wondering if you could spare a few minutes of your time to help me in a matter of love.\"\n\nOne of the men at the table began to stand up but Scarlett told him it was okay. Turning to Frank she kindly said, \"For a matter of love? Of course I'll help. How may I be of assistance?\"\n\nFrank pointed out his date to the actress. \"See her? I'm head of heels for that girl but nothing I do seems to impress her. This is our first date and I just know that if I don't do something drastic it will be our last. Is there any chance you could stop by our table and pretend to know me, like we're old friends or something? She's a huge fan of yours and I just know it would blow her mind if she thought we were good friends!\"\n\nScarlett laughed. \"Why not?\" she said. \"Go sit down, I'll *accidentally* notice you in a few minutes and make a bee-line to your table.\"\n\nAfter thanking her profusely Frank returned to his date. As promised, less than five minutes later he heard a shriek from across the room. \"FRANK?!\" Ms. Johansson cried. \n\n\"Oh my god!\" Amanda whispered. \"Is that Scarlett Johansson?\"\n\nFrank nodded as he watched the actress practically run in their direction, weaving between tables and dodging waiters as she did with a huge smile on her face. \n\n\"Frank Lester!\" she said, nearly breathless when she reached the table. \"Is that really you?!
