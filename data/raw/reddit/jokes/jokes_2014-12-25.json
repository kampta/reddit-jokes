There wasn\u2019t much snow but plenty of ice and rain.  During the month of December, Santa always begins to make sure his flying team is ready for the speedy night trip on the eve of Christmas.  Due to the weather, it was very rough going.  Now, you should know, it doesn\u2019t ever take all eight reindeer of them to pull the sleigh, but it helped share the load.  One could very well be enough, as they are magic.</p>\n\n<p>Something you may not know is that Santa wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Rudolph.  After that initial saving of Christmas, Rudolph became a bit of a diva.  She got her very own song and Christmas special.  It\u2019s not that Santa didn\u2019t like Rudolph, he just didn\u2019t like sharing the spotlight, and besides that he had eight others who never got as famous as Rudolph.  Everyone knows Rudolph, and sure some people can name the other eight, but not everyone can.</p>\n\n<p>Well, after all of this Christmas training, on the very Eve of Christmas, Santa came to check on his team.  Going to each individual stable one by one, as they all had their families or wanted privacy.  </p>\n\n<p>Dasher was the first he visited.  He spoke to Dasher and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho, are you ready to deliver Christmas joy to every girl and boy?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Dasher shook her head.  Yes, I said her.  You might not know this, but the males actually shed their antlers in the winter.  This makes all the reindeer with antlers pulling Santa\u2019s sleigh female! \u201cSanta, I can\u2019t pull any sleighs, I have a terrible sprain in my leg after that last training session!  The one where you made me dash across the ice\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Santa inspected her leg and nodded in agreement.  There was no way she could pull a sleigh without risking further injury.  Santa then came to Dancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Dancer, it looks like you\u2019ll be taking the lead on your own, Dasher won\u2019t be able to come out on her leg.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>Dancer shook her head, \u201cA dancer shouldn\u2019t go out without her partner, and I haven\u2019t practiced with any of the others.  I don\u2019t want to risk crashing the sleigh.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Santa pondered this for a moment and nodded in agreement.  It would be dangerous for Dancer to be alone at the front.  Santa with his belly like a bowl full of jelly, walked to Prancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Prancer, you and Vixen will have to be at the front of the sleigh tonight, Dasher has sprained her leg, and Dancer can\u2019t be with a partner she hasn\u2019t been training with.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Prancer shook her head, \u201cI\u2019ve just not been in the mood for Christmas with all of this wet weather.  I\u2019ve nothing to preen or prance about lately.\u201d  She looked very depressed!</p>\n\n<p>Santa sighed and nodded in agreement.  He understood the gray, wet, and damp weather had taken a toll on everyone.  Prancer was normally so full of joy, but this weather had drained her.  Santa moved on and with his beard of white he entered Vixen\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Vixen you\u2019re going to be the lead on this year\u2019s Christmas of five pulling the slegh!  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, and Prancer doesn\u2019t have the Christmas spirit to fly\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Vixen shook her head, \u201cSanta, I would love to be the lead, but if you remember I requested this year off so I can stay with some of the bucks this year.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>Santa pulled out his notebook from his coat, saw in his own handwriting that Vixen was on vacation, and nodded in agreement.  With a twinkle in his eye, he moved to Comet\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Comet, my girl, are you ready to fall on the rooftops this Christmas?  I\u2019m half-staffed now: Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, and Vixen has the day off.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Comet shook her head.  \u201cSanta, you know I need the stars in the sky if I\u2019m going to be in the front!  I wouldn\u2019t know the North Pole from the South Pole without them!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Santa stepped outside, looked up and saw the clouds blanketing the sky above, and nodded in agreement.  With his rosy cheeks he came to Cupid\u2019s stable only to find it empty.  He moved onto Donner\u2019s stable, and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!\u201d  Cupid and Donner were nuzzling against each other.  \u201cWell you two, are you ready to go \u2018Click, click, click!\u2019?  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, Vixen has the day off, and Comet needs the stars to be in front!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Cupid and Donner shook their heads, \u201cSanta, we told you we would only do it if both of us can be side by side in the front.\u201d  Santa told them sadly he couldn\u2019t make that happen this year.  They said they would take legal action if they couldn\u2019t.  </p>\n\n<p>Santa thought about the Christmas lawsuit, and nodded in agreement.  He moved on to his last hope before having to ask Rudolph.  Blitzen!  Opening the stable door he said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Blitzen looks like it\u2019ll just be me and you!  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, Vixen has the day off, Comet needs the stars, and Cupid and Donner threatened to sue me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Blitzen spoke up, \u201cThat\u2019s a bingo!  Ve could first go to Poland, and then, very quickly, move into France.  They von\u2019t know vhat them Santa Claus!\u201d  Hearing this Santa\u2019s eyes went wide.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think I remember why you don\u2019t lead the sleigh!  We will start in the United States as always!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Blitzen shook her head, \u201cNein!  Unless ve use my plan I von\u2019t fly!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Santa nodded in agreement that she wouldn\u2019t fly.  He sighed and went to Rudolph\u2019s stable that was so much fancier than the others.  Adorned with lights and decorations, it was heated and carpeted.  A security guard stood at the front.  \u201cName?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHo, ho, ho! It\u2019s me Santa Clause\u201d Santa sighed.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want with Miss Rudolph?\u201d  The guard asked</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would like to ask her to guide my sleigh tonight.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Rudolph came out hearing the familiar voice and said, \u201cOh Mr. Clause, you really are something.  You come to me after all this time, and only when you need me.  Well, I don\u2019t need you anymore!  But\u2026for old time\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll help you out.  Who knows?  Maybe I\u2019ll get a new song.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Around the world they went in a flash.  The presents were delivered, Rudolph\u2019s nose, as usual, being the gaudy signal which Santa hated.  After he came back home, he sat and his chair and spoke to Mrs. Clause.  Tired and beat he said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!  It was an awful trip this year.  Rudolph was insufferable.  I wish at least some of the others were there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mrs. Clause looked at him and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect them all to fly in the rain, dear!\u201d</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "It had been a strange and rough winter at the North Pole.  There wasn\u2019t much snow but plenty of ice and rain.  During the month of December, Santa always begins to make sure his flying team is ready for the speedy night trip on the eve of Christmas.  Due to the weather, it was very rough going.  Now, you should know, it doesn\u2019t ever take all eight reindeer of them to pull the sleigh, but it helped share the load.  One could very well be enough, as they are magic.\n                \nSomething you may not know is that Santa wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Rudolph.  After that initial saving of Christmas, Rudolph became a bit of a diva.  She got her very own song and Christmas special.  It\u2019s not that Santa didn\u2019t like Rudolph, he just didn\u2019t like sharing the spotlight, and besides that he had eight others who never got as famous as Rudolph.  Everyone knows Rudolph, and sure some people can name the other eight, but not everyone can.\n                \nWell, after all of this Christmas training, on the very Eve of Christmas, Santa came to check on his team.  Going to each individual stable one by one, as they all had their families or wanted privacy.  \n                \nDasher was the first he visited.  He spoke to Dasher and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho, are you ready to deliver Christmas joy to every girl and boy?\u201d \n                \nDasher shook her head.  Yes, I said her.  You might not know this, but the males actually shed their antlers in the winter.  This makes all the reindeer with antlers pulling Santa\u2019s sleigh female! \u201cSanta, I can\u2019t pull any sleighs, I have a terrible sprain in my leg after that last training session!  The one where you made me dash across the ice\u201d\n                \nSanta inspected her leg and nodded in agreement.  There was no way she could pull a sleigh without risking further injury.  Santa then came to Dancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Dancer, it looks like you\u2019ll be taking the lead on your own, Dasher won\u2019t be able to come out on her leg.\u201d  \n                \nDancer shook her head, \u201cA dancer shouldn\u2019t go out without her partner, and I haven\u2019t practiced with any of the others.  I don\u2019t want to risk crashing the sleigh.\u201d\n                \nSanta pondered this for a moment and nodded in agreement.  It would be dangerous for Dancer to be alone at the front.  Santa with his belly like a bowl full of jelly, walked to Prancer\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Prancer, you and Vixen will have to be at the front of the sleigh tonight, Dasher has sprained her leg, and Dancer can\u2019t be with a partner she hasn\u2019t been training with.\u201d\n                \nPrancer shook her head, \u201cI\u2019ve just not been in the mood for Christmas with all of this wet weather.  I\u2019ve nothing to preen or prance about lately.\u201d  She looked very depressed!\n                \nSanta sighed and nodded in agreement.  He understood the gray, wet, and damp weather had taken a toll on everyone.  Prancer was normally so full of joy, but this weather had drained her.  Santa moved on and with his beard of white he entered Vixen\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Vixen you\u2019re going to be the lead on this year\u2019s Christmas of five pulling the slegh!  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, and Prancer doesn\u2019t have the Christmas spirit to fly\u201d\n                \nVixen shook her head, \u201cSanta, I would love to be the lead, but if you remember I requested this year off so I can stay with some of the bucks this year.\u201d  \n                \nSanta pulled out his notebook from his coat, saw in his own handwriting that Vixen was on vacation, and nodded in agreement.  With a twinkle in his eye, he moved to Comet\u2019s stable.  \u201cHo, ho, ho!  Comet, my girl, are you ready to fall on the rooftops this Christmas?  I\u2019m half-staffed now: Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, and Vixen has the day off.\u201d\n                \nComet shook her head.  \u201cSanta, you know I need the stars in the sky if I\u2019m going to be in the front!  I wouldn\u2019t know the North Pole from the South Pole without them!\u201d\n                \nSanta stepped outside, looked up and saw the clouds blanketing the sky above, and nodded in agreement.  With his rosy cheeks he came to Cupid\u2019s stable only to find it empty.  He moved onto Donner\u2019s stable, and said, \u201cHo, ho, ho!\u201d  Cupid and Donner were nuzzling against each other.  \u201cWell you two, are you ready to go \u2018Click, click, click!\u2019?  Dasher sprained her leg, Dancer needs a partner, Prancer is feeling down, Vixen has the day off, and Comet needs the stars to be in front!\u201d\n                \nCupid and Donner shook their heads, \u201cSanta, we told you we would only do it if both of us can be side by side in the front.\u201d  Santa told them sadly he couldn\u2019t make that happen this year.

Ve could first go to Poland, and then, very quickly, move into France.  They von\u2019t know vhat them Santa Claus!\u201d  Hearing this Santa\u2019s eyes went wide.\n                \n\u201cI think I remember why you don\u2019t lead the sleigh!

A security guard stood at the front.  \u201cName?\u201d\n                \n\u201cHo, ho, ho!

You come to me after all this time, and only when you need me.  Well, I don\u2019t need you anymore!  But\u2026for old time\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll help you out.  Who knows?

You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the bartender is understandably ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship.

But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster.

And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And then he starts to cry.

And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.</p>\n\n<p>And suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.

I\u2019m worthless!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be?
