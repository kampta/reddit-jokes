You don&#39;t smoke, you don&#39;t drink, you don&#39;t beat the wife and kids, and you don&#39;t kick that cute little armadillo against the street. You should run for president of the school board!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And so Wan ran for president of the school board, and he won in a landslide! It wasn&#39;t long until the community took notice of what a great job he was doing, and several people walked up to him and said &quot;Hey Wan, you&#39;re an outstanding guy! You don&#39;t smoke, you don&#39;t drink, you don&#39;t beat the wife and kids, and you don&#39;t kick the armadillo across the street. You should run for governor!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So Wan ran for governor, and lo and behold, he won in a landslide! However, he&#39;d hardly been in this position long before news of his good deeds spread worldwide. Every day he would get emails that said &quot;Hey Wan, you are really an exceptional guy! You don&#39;t smoke, you don&#39;t drink, you don&#39;t beat your wife and kids, and you never kick that armadillo across the street. You would the best president the US has ever seen!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Wan figures he might as well give it a shot, and he ends up getting 96% of the vote, which of course meant he won in a landslide! So Wan becomes president of the United States.</p>\n\n<p>One day, as Wan is walking along, he is suddenly pulled into an alleyway. There, a shady-looking man confronts him, brandishing a golf gun. He says &quot;Look Wan, you&#39;re a great guy. You don&#39;t smoke, you don&#39;t drink, you don&#39;t beat the wife and kids, and not once have you kicked that armadillo across the street. But you know what? I don&#39;t like you. I would kill you right here, but I don&#39;t want that kind of blood on my hands. Tell you what: if you find a way to tarnish your own reputation so you get impeached, I&#39;ll spare your life and the lives of your family members. We got a deal?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Wan nodded grimly. On the long walk back to the White House, he thought about how he could ruin his reputation. He decided he should start smoking, but not just any kind of smoking. No, Wan started smoking crack. It didn&#39;t take long for the public to discover his new addiction, and he was soon impeached and resigned. Still, he was allowed to run for governor again and, once again, won in a landslide! As he&#39;s walking around after the election, he is pulled into an alley by the same shady guy as before. &quot;Look Wan,&quot; he says, &quot;you don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t beat the wife and kids, and still haven&#39;t kicked that armadillo. That being said, I still don&#39;t like you. I&#39;ll spare your life again, but only if you agree to get impeached and resign as governor.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Wan, scared for his life and the lives of his loved ones, again agreed. He started to drink, but not just lightly. No, Wan would do shots until he passed out. When he ran out of money, he would drink the drippings from the bar mop in desperation. After a scandal involving a DUI, he was impeached and again resigned. Still, he had his old job as president of the school board. One day as he is walking along, he gets pulled into another alley by the same man. He says &quot;I see that you&#39;ve started drinking, Wan, but you still haven&#39;t beating the wife and kids, and that armadillo still hasn&#39;t been kicked across the street. That means I still don&#39;t like you. If you get fired from your job, though, I might let you and your family live.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Wan nodded sadly and walked back home, stopping at no less than 3 bars on the way there. In his state of drunken depression, he started the savagely beat his wife and kids. The neighbors called the police and Wan was arrested and fired on the spot. Still, at least he had his position as president of the PTA. As he is stumbling home after spending a month in jail (and a night out drinking), he walks into an alley to smoke some crack and, to his surprise, sees the shady guy standing there. &quot;Hey Wan,&quot; the guy says, &quot;it looks like your life is falling apart. But every day I see you walk past that armadillo without kicking it, I hate you a little more. Tell you what, if you get kicked out of your spot as PTA president, I&#39;ll leave you alone.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Wan, figuring he doesn&#39;t have much to lose, agrees. The next day, while leaving his house, Wan spots the armadillo. At first, he hesitates. There sits the armadillo, innocent as can be. His leathery shell glistens in the sun. His beady, black eyes stare out from his adorably wrinkled face. Wan almost gives in to the armadillo&#39;s cuteness, but fearing for his life, he draws back a leg and kicks the armadillo so hard that it flies across the street. A fellow PTA member witnesses this and immediately asks the other members to kick Wan out.</p>\n\n<p>A week later, Wan is shuffling down the street, aged beyond his years. He is suddenly pulled into an alley by none other than the shady guy. He says &quot;Wan, I know you&#39;ve been through a lot. You started smoking crack, you started drinking, you beat the crap out of your wife and kids, and just a week ago you finally punted that armadillo across the street. But you know what? After all that you have lost, I <em>still</em> don&#39;t like you. I&#39;m not worried about your family, but I&#39;m going to have to kill you.&quot; And with that, the man pulls out his gun and shoots Wan dead.</p>\n\n<p>A few hours later, police are on the scene. The police chief looks at Wan, lying there in the alley, and sadly shakes his head. This guy used to be so great. He didn&#39;t smoke, he didn&#39;t drink, he never laid a finger on his wife and kids, and he was so nice to that little armadillo. The chief couldn&#39;t help but wonder what could cause a man to fall so far. Presently, the head detective on the case walks up to the chief. &quot;So,&quot; the chief says, &quot;any new leads?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The detective says &quot;Well, forensics says that the murder weapon was a golf gun.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The chief cocks his head to the side. &quot;A golf gun?
