Why aren&#39;t I dying now?

First, yes, you can ask me a question.&quot; The snake&#39;s grin gets\nwider. &quot;Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\nto drink. That&#39;s what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\nbe thirsty any more - but &#39;any more&#39; is such a vague term. I decided to make\nit permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn&#39;t need to drink much at\nall. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\nget enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\nYou&#39;ve been changed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;For the third question,&quot; Nate continues, &quot;you are still dying. Besides the\neffects of that methanol in your system, you&#39;re a man - and men are mortal.\nIn your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\nAssuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is.&quot; Nate seemed vastly\namused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As for the fourth question,&quot; Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\ncould tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\ntalking-snake emotions from snake facial features, &quot;first you have to agree\nto make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can&#39;t tell\nyou.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; joked Jack, &quot;isn&#39;t this where you say you could tell me, but you&#39;d\nhave to kill me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I thought that was implied.&quot; Nate continued to look serious.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ummm...yeah.&quot; Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\ntalking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\nnasty temper. &quot;So, what is this &#39;Bound by Secrecy&#39; stuff, and can you really\nstop the effects of the methanol?&quot; Jack thought for a second. &quot;And, what do\nyou mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\nfluid, and just denature it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They may, I don&#39;t really know,&quot; said Nate. &quot;I haven&#39;t gotten out in a\nwhile. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\non that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\npulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\nthat they still color wiper fluid blue?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yeah, they do,&quot; said Jack.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I figured,&quot; replied Nate. &quot;As for being bound by secrecy - with the\nfulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\nthis place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\ndecide to go back out to your kind. You won&#39;t be allowed to talk about me,\nwrite about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\nlead someone to guess correctly about me. You&#39;ll be bound to secrecy. Of\ncourse, I&#39;ll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I&#39;m\nguessing that you&#39;re a man of your word, you&#39;ll never test the binding\nanyway, so you won&#39;t notice.&quot; Nate said the last part with utter confidence.</p>\n\n<p>Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\nlittle nervous at this. &quot;Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\nthat? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Well, Jack,&quot; said Nate sadly, &quot;I can&#39;t tell you that, unless you make the\nsecond request.&quot; Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Umm, well, ok,&quot; said Jack, &quot;what is this about a second request? What can I\nask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sure!&quot; said Nate, brightening. &quot;You&#39;re allowed to ask for changes. Changes\nto yourself. They&#39;re like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\nbefore you ask, I can&#39;t give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\nomnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\nand yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\nsort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn&#39;t be\nomniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\nuseful, at least in my opinion.&quot; Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\nstaring at him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, anyway,&quot; continued Nate, &quot;I&#39;d probably suggest giving you permanent\ngood health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you&#39;d be\nimmune to most poisons and diseases, and you&#39;d tend to live a very long\ntime, barring accident, of course. And you&#39;ll even have a tendency to\nrecover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\nrequest to me.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?&quot; said Jack. &quot;And keep me healthy for a\nlong time? Hmmm. It doesn&#39;t sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\nabout a change to me? I can&#39;t ask to be rich, right? Because that&#39;s not\nreally a change to me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Right,&quot; nodded Nate.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?&quot; Jack asked, hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That takes two requests, Jack.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I figured so,&quot; said Jack. &quot;But I could ask to be a genius? I could\nbecome the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, I could make you very smart,&quot; admitted Nate, &quot;but that wouldn&#39;t\nnecessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\nvery athletic, but it wouldn&#39;t necessarily make you the best athlete either.\nYou&#39;ve heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there&#39;s some\ntruth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can&#39;t make you work hard. It\nall depends on what you decide to do with it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; said Jack. &quot;Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\nafter this one?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Nate, &quot;it depends on what you decide then. There are more\nrules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\nrequest. You know how it goes.&quot; Nate looked like he&#39;d shrug, if he had\nshoulders.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ok, well, since I&#39;d rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\nhealth doesn&#39;t sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\nDo I need to sign in blood or something?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Nate. &quot;Just hold out your hand. Or heel.&quot; Nate grinned. &quot;Or\nwhatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\nthat&#39;s how it works - the poison, you know,&quot; Nate said apologetically.</p>\n\n<p>Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\ndidn&#39;t hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\nabout the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\nsnake sunk it&#39;s fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\nbe able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\ntried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\nwouldn&#39;t hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn&#39;t going to be easy.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hey, Jack,&quot; Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\nhim, &quot;is that someone else coming up over there?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Jack spun around and looked.

After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he&#39;s caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.</p>\n\n<p>He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\nhe clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\nin the sand it still there and he hadn&#39;t just imagined it.</p>\n\n<p>So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\nto crawl towards it. He&#39;d get up and walk towards it, but he doesn&#39;t seem to\nhave the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\nof dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn&#39;t\nhave water, he&#39;ll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\nchance.</p>\n\n<p>He gets closer and closer, but still can&#39;t see what&#39;s in the middle of the\ndark area. His eyes won&#39;t quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\nhis head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\nkeeps crawling.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, he reaches the area he&#39;d seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he&#39;s no longer on sand - he&#39;s now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He&#39;s too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\nwhere his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\narea.</p>\n\n<p>His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\nstone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\noverhead, doesn&#39;t seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\ndown on the nice cool surface.</p>\n\n<p>Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He&#39;s\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\ndying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\nbeautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\na drink. Then he&#39;ll know he&#39;s gone.</p>\n\n<p>He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he&#39;s going to die here\nin the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what&#39;s in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he&#39;s\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, &quot;Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it&#39;s too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\ndifferent - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\nseconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\ntries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\nand tries again. Better this time.</p>\n\n<p>Yep. He can see. He&#39;s sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\nof stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\npole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\nout of the stone, at an angle.</p>\n\n<p>And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\nseeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\ndesert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.</p>\n\n<p>He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn&#39;t have the energy to get up and\nrun away. He doesn&#39;t even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\nfinal resting place. No matter what happens, he&#39;s not going to be able to\nmove from this spot.</p>\n\n<p>Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\ndying of thirst. He&#39;ll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\nlittle straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\nit in the snake&#39;s direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\nmoment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn&#39;t rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn&#39;t going to die of snake bite after all.</p>\n\n<p>He then remembers that he&#39;d looked up when he&#39;d reached the center here\nbecause he thought he&#39;d heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\nlikely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\nnow on cool stone. He still didn&#39;t have anything to drink. But maybe he had\nactually heard a voice. This stone didn&#39;t look natural. Nor did that white\npost sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\nthey were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\nwas even their pet, and that&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t biting.</p>\n\n<p>He tries to clear his throat to say, &quot;Hello,&quot; but his throat is too dry. All\nthat comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he&#39;s going\nto be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\nbottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\nalmost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn&#39;t\ngood. He doesn&#39;t have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\nout.</p>\n\n<p>He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\nand pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\nswallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\nnow.</p>\n\n<p>He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\nspot the owner of this place, and croaks out, &quot;Hello? Is there anyone here?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He hears, from his side, &quot;Greetings. What is it that you want?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He turns his head, back towards the snake. That&#39;s where the sound had seemed\nto come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\nspeaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\nto try asking for help.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Please,&quot; he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, &quot;I&#39;d love to not be\nthirsty any more. I&#39;ve been a long time without water. Can you help me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\ncoming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\nmouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\nfalls forward, face first on the stone, &quot;Very well. Coming up.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\nup and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He&#39;s momentarily\ndisoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\nsand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\naround the tilted white post, still looking at him.</p>\n\n<p>He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\nHe pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\nagain - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\nthey match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\nbitten. By the snake.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;ll feel better in a minute.&quot; He looks up - it&#39;s the snake talking. He\nhadn&#39;t dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he&#39;s not dizzy any more. And more\nimportantly, he&#39;s not thirsty any more - at all!</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\nafterlife?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,&quot; says the snake. &quot;That&#39;s the way I\nwork. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You bit me to help me? Why aren&#39;t I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\ndrink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\nthirsty any more? I haven&#39;t had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\nthe windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\nAre you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; says the snake, &quot;I&#39;m real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\ndidn&#39;t give you a drink. I bit you. That&#39;s how it works - it&#39;s what I do. I\nbite. I don&#39;t have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\nsitting around here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\ndesert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn&#39;t, talking to a\nsnake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\ngreat - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\nlonger thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\nhot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\nstone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\ndying of thirst.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "**[Part 1 is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/10ugw6/the_longest_joke_in_the_world_part_1/)**\n\nHe puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\nAfter a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\nHe stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\nenergy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\nhe clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\nin the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.\n\nSo, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\nto crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to\nhave the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\nof dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't\nhave water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\nchance.\n\nHe gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the\ndark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\nhis head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\nkeeps crawling.\n\nFinally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\nwhere his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\narea.\n\nHis mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\nstone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\noverhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\ndown on the nice cool surface.\n\nCool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's\nprobably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\ndying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\nbeautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\na drink. Then he'll know he's gone.\n\nHe decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here\nin the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the\ncenter before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\nIt's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's\nhearing. He would swear that someone just said, \"Greetings, traveler. You do\nnot look well. Do you hear me?\"\n\nHe stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\nknees, but it's too much effort to lift his head.

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.</p>\n\n<p>He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he&#39;d paid attention to the sun and thought he&#39;d figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he&#39;d be back to the small town he&#39;d gotten gas in last.</p>\n\n<p>He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\nhow dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he&#39;s afraid that he&#39;ll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\nhe puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\nlater, brings an umbrella he&#39;d had in the back of the SUV with him to give\nhim a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\nin case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\ndirection he thinks is right.</p>\n\n<p>He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he&#39;s really thirsty. He&#39;s\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He&#39;s reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it&#39;s mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\nwhether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.</p>\n\n<p>He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he&#39;s been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\ntown. But he doesn&#39;t recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn&#39;t remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he&#39;s close, and that after dark he&#39;ll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that&#39;ll be all he needs.</p>\n\n<p>As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\nhe finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.</p>\n\n<p>Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\nup and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.</p>\n\n<p>He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they&#39;re full of sand. He so thirsty that he can&#39;t even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He&#39;d forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn&#39;t noticed it the night before because he&#39;d been in his car.</p>\n\n<p>He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn&#39;t the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.</p>\n\n<p>He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\nhis mind? He&#39;s not sure. He&#39;ll go a little farther, and if he still doesn&#39;t\nfind water, he&#39;ll try drinking some of the fluid.</p>\n\n<p>Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.</p>\n\n<p>As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you&#39;re in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.</p>\n\n<p>He decides that it&#39;s time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can&#39;t wait\nany longer - if he passes out, he&#39;s dead. He stops in the shade of a large\nrock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\nswallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\nand cracked throat that he doesn&#39;t even care about the nasty taste. He takes\nanother mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\nHe figures that since he&#39;s drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\nmake some difference and keep himself from passing out.</p>\n\n<p>He&#39;s quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him - if he didn&#39;t drink it, he&#39;d die anyway. Besides, he&#39;s pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.</p>\n\n<p>He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he&#39;ll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He&#39;s careful to stay away from the movements.</p>\n\n<p>After a while, he begins to stagger. He&#39;s not sure if it&#39;s fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.</p>\n\n<p>After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\ndonuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he&#39;s getting woozy\nenough and tired enough that he&#39;s not sure what he remembers any more or if\nhe&#39;s hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\ntrying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.</p>\n\n<p>He was heading for a town, wasn&#39;t he? He thinks he was. He isn&#39;t sure any more. He&#39;s not even sure how long he&#39;s been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again?

There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\nHe stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\nand he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last.\n\nHe thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\nhow dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\nhe puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\nlater, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give\nhim a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\nin case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\ndirection he thinks is right.\n\nHe walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's\nbeen sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\nwhether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\nHe pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\nBy the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\ntown. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs.\n\nAs it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\nhe finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\nFull dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\nup and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\nHe wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car.\n\nHe knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\nHe rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\nhis mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't\nfind water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\nThen he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\nLooking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\nAs he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\nHe decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait\nany longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large\nrock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\nswallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\nand cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes\nanother mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\nHe figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\nmake some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\nHe's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\nit kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty\nsure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\nHe walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\ndunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\nSometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements.\n\nAfter a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat\nstroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\nAfter more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\nknows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\ndonuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy\nenough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if\nhe's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\ntrying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\nHe was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.\n\nHe walks through the sand.\n\nAfter a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't\nremember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\ndoesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\nBut, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\nthat he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\nthere that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\nHalfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\ntime, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll\njust fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\nWhile crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally\ngotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\nthe sand on his hands and knees.
