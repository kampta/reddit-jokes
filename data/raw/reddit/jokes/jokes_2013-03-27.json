A bit nervous, he asks the bishop for some advice and guidance. \n\n\"Son\", says the bishop, \"here, take this book, I've listed all the common sins and their penance so don't be nervous at all\".\n\nArmed with the book, the priest waits in the confessional booth for people to come and sure enough, a young lad comes in and says: \"Forgive me father, I have sinned; I made out with a girl yesterday night for a full hour.\"\n\nThe priest looks in his book and finds Kissing and according to the punishment listed there, tells the lad: \"Son, go say five hail Mary's and may The Lord be with you.\"\n\nNext comes in a woman, \"Forgive me father, I have sinned, I am not married but yesterday I had mind blowing fucking with a man.\"\n\nThe priest looks in his books and lo and behold, the sin of fucking is listed there so he tells the woman; \"May The Lord forgive you my child, you must say 10 hail Mary's.\"\n\nFinally, a teenage girl comes in and says, \"Forgive me father for I have sinned, yesterday after school my boyfriend fingered my pussy.\"\n\nThe priest looks in his book over and over again but he can't find anything for \"pussy fingering\" - there's fucking, kissing, sucking, even dirty Sanchez listed in the book, but no pussy fingering. Finally, frustrated, he opens the confessional booth window, looks the girl straight in the eye and says, \"Listen honey, why don't you go and fuck somebody and come back!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The new priest and the confessional booth.
