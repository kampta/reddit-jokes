The ladies house is pink, the grass is pink, the trees are pink, the wall are pink. He knocks on the door, the pink lady answers. Her hair is pink, her mouth is pink with pink teeth her skin? pink. She answers the pink door, with the pink knocker and the man askes to borrow her phone. She says yes and allows him to use the pink phone on the pink table with the pink buttons, pink cord. He uses the phone the repairman says it'll be a day. The man asks if he can stay. She says fine and points him to a blue room, with blue floors, blue chairs, blue bed and blue lights. The next day he has a bowl of pink cheerios and then leaves. A week later a man goes to the same green house, with the green trees, green grass green walls with the women in green clothes, with green hair, green lipstick and green teeth. He ask can i borrow your phone? She says sure, so he goes to the green table, with the green wallpaper, green phone with the green buttons and green cord. He calls and the man says ill be there tomorrow. So the man asks, can i  stay the night. She says sure, she points him to the orange room with orange sheets, and orange blankets, and orange light and orange wallpaper. In the morning he wakes up has a bowl of orange fruit loops and leaves. The following week a mans car breaks down, he goes to the women with the yellow house, the yellow garage, yellow car, yellow shoes. He says my car breaks down, and asks if he can call the repairman. Woman says sure so he uses the yellow phone hanging on the yellow wall, with a yellow cord and yellow rotary dialer and the repairman says itll be a day. He goes to the woman and asks if he can stay the night. She says sure so he goes into the purple room with purple light, purple sheets, and purple walls, and purple glass and sleeps. In the morning he has yellow cheerios and leaves. Moral of the story? two out of three people love cheerios.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false,
