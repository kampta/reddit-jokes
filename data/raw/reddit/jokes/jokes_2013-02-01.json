You get one take. This had better be good.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The family of tabby cats rearrange themselves, and look expectantly at the tomcat, as though waiting for his cue. He nods quickly and the two kittens run at each other. The male extends his front paws as his sister vaults into a handstand on top of them, spreading her rear to expose her glistening vulva. This display of gymnastics attracts the attention of the tomcat, who sticks his nose and mouth firmly between her legs, while the pregnant cat begins to wail a few bars of a vaudeville song that the intern is unfamiliar with, but the bulldog has heard once or twice. The tomcat screeches, spraying urine and pheromones all over the pregnant mother before displaying his now-erect penis, bristling with sharp spines. Both the bulldog and chihuahua are speechless at this jowl-dropping display, and the cigar falls to the floor.</p>\n\n<p>On a downbeat in the mother&#39;s wailed song, the tomcat opens the door as the two kittens scramble to the side of their mother, singing harmony on the line &quot;everybody wants to be a cat.&quot; A larger-than-average doberman comes through the open door and sits in the middle of the scene. The tomcat bends forward, caressing the tip of his tumescent, barbed penis and sucking with his mouth at the crotch of the doberman. Meanwhile, the two kittens grab the distending walls of the pregnant cat&#39;s cervix as she gives birth to a litter of four kittens, one after the other, right on the floor of the talent agency. The doberman, seeing the sudden shock of birth on the mother&#39;s face, licks his chops as his turgid penis bursts out of its sheath, shiny and red as a tomato. With this, the chihuahua intern shivers a little as the bulldog tries to regain his composure while fighting a small twinge of jealousy at the size of the doberman&#39;s member.</p>\n\n<p>The doberman approaches the mother, while the tomcat begins to hump the placenta like a horny teenager on a dirty sofa cushion. The two kittens who&#39;d assisted with the birth back away, making wide gestures with their paws at their postpartum mother&#39;s gaping vagina. The doberman rocks his hips back and forth, rolling his swelling penis against the umblical cords like violin strings to the beat of the winded mother&#39;s song. The two oldest kittens pick up the tune for their mother as she picks each of the newborns up and sucks the fluids from their fur. The bulldog behind his desk leans over and whispers to his intern, &quot;that part makes sense, at least.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The tomcat breaks away from the placenta as the mother finishes cleaning her infants, then begins raking the barbs on his twitching penis against several boils on the back of his mate&#39;s flank. One of them bursts, spilling pus down her coat and onto the floor. The doberman scoops up the male kitten from the side of the room and shoves his giant cock through the cat&#39;s virgin rectum and all the way out through his mouth. With the head of his penis dripping and exposed, the doberman takes aim at one of the newborn cats and penetrates its tiny vulva, making her seconds-old eyes pop open and roll back in her head. With this, the doberman comes hard, biting the head off the infant and dripping semen down to the ground. The bulldog and intern are aghast, recoiling back into their chairs.</p>\n\n<p>The oldest female holds the exposed esophagus of the deceased infant, defecating lumps into the wound and puffing the body up like a balloon. The mother cat snatches the body up, licking the fur, and slowly sliding the body in and out of her still-gaping snatch. The other newborns instinctively begin to lap up the mixture of pus and semen on the floor like milk from a saucer, trading with each other in a show of generosity. The tomcat, still erect and pulsing with excitement, grabs the chihuahua from her seat by the back of the neck, and begins penetrating her unaroused mound while singing about making pussies purr. The bulldog is frozen with shock and horror as his intern&#39;s body betrays her.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the mother&#39;s masturbatory lump becomes too much for her and she shudders, coming hard and squeezing the feces from the decapitated body of her child. The tomcat, the mother, and the doberman all harmonize on the last note of the song as the tomcat climaxes inside the chihuahua. As the tomcat pulls his spined phallus from the raw and bloody canine sex, the chihuahua&#39;s guilty orgasm adds one more note to the song as the group finishes together.</p>\n\n<p>Everything is silent, except for the low licking of the three surviving infants against the sticky texture on the floor. The group takes a bow as the chihuahua passes out. With this, the bulldog gasps, reaching a trembling paw for the dropped cigar. He replaces the stogie in his mouth, not seeming to notice the dark dribble of blood-darkened interspecies semen on the tip.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, after what seems like an eternity, the bulldog is finally able to force some words from his mouth.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, what the hell do you call that act?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The tomcat&#39;s eyes sparkle.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The Aristocats!&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "A family of tabby cats walks into a talent agency run by a bulldog and his intern.

This display of gymnastics attracts the attention of the tomcat, who sticks his nose and mouth firmly between her legs, while the pregnant cat begins to wail a few bars of a vaudeville song that the intern is unfamiliar with, but the bulldog has heard once or twice. The tomcat screeches, spraying urine and pheromones all over the pregnant mother before displaying his now-erect penis, bristling with sharp spines. Both the bulldog and chihuahua are speechless at this jowl-dropping display, and the cigar falls to the floor.\n\nOn a downbeat in the mother's wailed song, the tomcat opens the door as the two kittens scramble to the side of their mother, singing harmony on the line \"everybody wants to be a cat.\" A larger-than-average doberman comes through the open door and sits in the middle of the scene. The tomcat bends forward, caressing the tip of his tumescent, barbed penis and sucking with his mouth at the crotch of the doberman. Meanwhile, the two kittens grab the distending walls of the pregnant cat's cervix as she gives birth to a litter of four kittens, one after the other, right on the floor of the talent agency. The doberman, seeing the sudden shock of birth on the mother's face, licks his chops as his turgid penis bursts out of its sheath, shiny and red as a tomato. With this, the chihuahua intern shivers a little as the bulldog tries to regain his composure while fighting a small twinge of jealousy at the size of the doberman's member.\n\nThe doberman approaches the mother, while the tomcat begins to hump the placenta like a horny teenager on a dirty sofa cushion. The two kittens who'd assisted with the birth back away, making wide gestures with their paws at their postpartum mother's gaping vagina. The doberman rocks his hips back and forth, rolling his swelling penis against the umblical cords like violin strings to the beat of the winded mother's song. The two oldest kittens pick up the tune for their mother as she picks each of the newborns up and sucks the fluids from their fur. The bulldog behind his desk leans over and whispers to his intern, \"that part makes sense, at least.\"\n\nThe tomcat breaks away from the placenta as the mother finishes cleaning her infants, then begins raking the barbs on his twitching penis against several boils on the back of his mate's flank. One of them bursts, spilling pus down her coat and onto the floor. The doberman scoops up the male kitten from the side of the room and shoves his giant cock through the cat's virgin rectum and all the way out through his mouth. With the head of his penis dripping and exposed, the doberman takes aim at one of the newborn cats and penetrates its tiny vulva, making her seconds-old eyes pop open and roll back in her head. With this, the doberman comes hard, biting the head off the infant and dripping semen down to the ground. The bulldog and intern are aghast, recoiling back into their chairs.\n\nThe oldest female holds the exposed esophagus of the deceased infant, defecating lumps into the wound and puffing the body up like a balloon. The mother cat snatches the body up, licking the fur, and slowly sliding the body in and out of her still-gaping snatch. The other newborns instinctively begin to lap up the mixture of pus and semen on the floor like milk from a saucer, trading with each other in a show of generosity. The tomcat, still erect and pulsing with excitement, grabs the chihuahua from her seat by the back of the neck, and begins penetrating her unaroused mound while singing about making pussies purr. The bulldog is frozen with shock and horror as his intern's body betrays her.\n\nFinally, the mother's masturbatory lump becomes too much for her and she shudders, coming hard and squeezing the feces from the decapitated body of her child. The tomcat, the mother, and the doberman all harmonize on the last note of the song as the tomcat climaxes inside the chihuahua. As the tomcat pulls his spined phallus from the raw and bloody canine sex, the chihuahua's guilty orgasm adds one more note to the song as the group finishes together.\n\nEverything is silent, except for the low licking of the three surviving infants against the sticky texture on the floor. The group takes a bow as the chihuahua passes out. With this, the bulldog gasps, reaching a trembling paw for the dropped cigar. He replaces the stogie in his mouth, not seeming to notice the dark dribble of blood-darkened interspecies semen on the tip.\n\nFinally, after what seems like an eternity, the bulldog is finally able to force some words from his mouth.\n\n\"Well, what the hell do you call that act?\"\n\nThe tomcat's eyes sparkle.\n\n\"The Aristocats!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "I hope reddit still likes cats", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": true, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_17ncoo", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/17ncoo/i_hope_reddit_still_likes_cats/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "17ncoo", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "verbose_man", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/17ncoo/i_hope_reddit_still_likes_cats/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1359692040.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/17ncoo/i_hope_reddit_still_likes_cats/", "created_utc": 1359663240.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A real woman is a man&#39;s best friend.\nShe will never stand him up and never let him down.\nShe will reassure him when he feels insecure and comfort him \nafter a bad day.</p>\n\n<p>She will inspire him to do things he never thought he could do; to \nlive without fear and forget regret.\nShe will enable him to express his deepest emotions and give in to \nhis most intimate desires.</p>\n\n<p>She will make sure he always feels as though he&#39;s the most \nhandsome man in the room and will enable him to be the most confident, \nsexy, seductive and invincible...</p>\n\n<p>No wait...Sorry.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thinking of bourbon.
