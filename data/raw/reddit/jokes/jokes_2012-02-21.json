Move your hand up and down your thigh while massaging your breast.\n8) With your breast hand, slowly take the lip gloss container or your object of choice. Your clit might start to get a weird feeling like you really want to touch it. DON&#39;T.\n9) Tease yourself with the object by gently rubbing the spot between your poophole and vagina. This will drive you nuts. Slowly begin to touch and massage the part right above the hole. (I suggest you know where it is before you start all this.)\n10) Rub for a while. Gently, occasionally harder but not too hard yet.\n11) At this point you should be aching to rub harder and just get going. Again, don&#39;t. If you do not feel this yet, continue the teasing, very gently.\n12) Slowly move your fingers to the hole, don&#39;t put them in, but just finger it softly.\n13) Take your object and place it near the hole and your other hand. Take your free hand off the hole and start to massage your clit harder. (That&#39;s the spot above the hole)\n14) Slowly stick the object in. Gently, it shouldn&#39;t feel good yet. It might hurt a small amount going in. That means you&#39;ve bumped a sensitive spot. That&#39;s not a bad thing, just angle it a little and keep going.\n15) Once it&#39;s in as far as it can be without losing it to your pussy, begin slowly moving it in and out a little. Don&#39;t take it all the way out, just a little. Get faster, and faster. Start massaging your clit HARD. Go nuts. You might feel like your on the brink of an orgasm. You might have one. This feels very good.\n16) Then stick it in all the way and start pushing it back and forth hitting the sides of your hole. Faster, faster. Massage clit again.\n17) Repeat steps 15 and 16 as much as you want. If you take it out for longer than 30 seconds, I suggest you excite yourself again with the teasing. If you do, it will be worse. Since you have already done it, you&#39;re going to want it worse.\n18) I would stop with the lip gloss for now, don&#39;t go on to something bigger. Save that for another night.
