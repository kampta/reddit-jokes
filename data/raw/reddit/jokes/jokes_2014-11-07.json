Three men remain hunched over at the bar. Each has been there the whole night and has been drinking heavily, but none of them seem to have the strength or desire to strike up a conversation. \n\nAs the bartender cleans the last few glasses before he kicks the three men out, he decides it\u2019s worth a shot to try to cheer these poor guys up. He goes up to them and asks what\u2019s got them down. As it turns out, the three of them have all just been kicked out by their wives, who were unable to put up with their terrible worst traits. The bartender says to them: \n\n\u201cAnything that someone else sees as a bad trait can be spun around. Tell me your bad traits and I promise you I can show you a way that they help you in some way or even make you a better person.\u201d \n\nTwo of the men grudgingly agree, but the third is insistent. \n\n\u201cI promise you,\u201d he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to spin mine around.\u201d \n\nBut the bartender is insistent. \n\nThe first man offers up. \u201cMy wife kicked me out because she couldn\u2019t stand how lazy I was. Hard to see how you can spin that around.\u201d \n\nThe bartender immediately replies, \u201cThat\u2019s easy. Lazy people are great at finding ways to save themselves from wasting any unnecessary time or effort. Laziness can be a great motivator\u201d. \n\nThe second man pipes up \u201cWell my wife booted me because she couldn\u2019t stand my constant cynicism\u201d. The bartender quickly rebukes, \u201cAlways looking for and expecting the worst means that you can easily identify the worst possible outcome of situations in advance. That means you\u2019re more prepared to face the worst and you can plan ahead in case of the worst case scenario.\u201d \n\nAfter two solid responses the third man is impressed, but still adamant that the bartender won\u2019t be able to spin his huge flaw. The bartender remains insists that he can do it, though. \n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Says the third man. \u201cI\u2019m a pedophile.\"\n\n...\n\nThe bartender is visibly taken aback. \n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Says the third man. \u201cNo way to spin that\u201d. \n\n...\n\n\u201cWell\u201d, says the bartender after a pause, \u201cI bet that means you drive slowly through school zones!\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A bartender is closing down his bar", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2lk432", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2lk432/a_bartender_is_closing_down_his_bar/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2lk432", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GoochNibbler", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 126, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2lk432/a_bartender_is_closing_down_his_bar/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1415371344.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2lk432/a_bartender_is_closing_down_his_bar/", "created_utc": 1415342544.0, "ups": 126, "num_comments": 6}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><ol>\n<li>A child</li>\n<li>Feelings</li>\n<li>AIDS</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "1.
