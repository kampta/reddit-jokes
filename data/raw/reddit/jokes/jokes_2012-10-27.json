Unfortunately there's no signal. \n\nHowever, she sees in a distance, a bar.  \"There has to be a phone there!\" she says to herself.  Upon arriving at the bar, she tells the bartender, \"Excuse me, sir but I really need to use your phone; I lost my dad!\" \n\n\"Sorry the phone is for employees only\" the bartender replies.  The blonde grows desperate and begins thinking.  \"Please.. I'll do ANYTHING to use the phone\".  \"Anything huh?\" She nods.  The bartender gets the hint and takes her down to a dimly lit back room. He locks the door.\n\n\"Get on your knees\".  The blonde crouches down.  \n\"Unzip my pants\" the bartender commands.  The blonde slowly unzips his pants. \n\"Now pull it out\".  She reaches in and pulls out his penis.  \n\"You know what to do. Go on.\"\n\nThe blonde clears her throat. \"Hello?
