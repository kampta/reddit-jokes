I\u2019ve had hunners of pets, had dogs, had cats, had hamsters, had fish, I\u2019m looking for something different\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat about a turtle?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo I\u2019ve had 15 turtles!  Something original!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat about a lizard?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNae a fecking Lizard!  I\u2019ve had heaps of lizards I\u2019ve got lizards coming out my fecking ears!  Something different, something exciting!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat about a monkey, they\u2019re pretty original and exciting.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOriginal?!  I\u2019ve had mair monkeys then I\u2019ve had shags!  Unless you can offer me something that no one else has got, then I\u2019m walking out this shop!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The shopkeeper thought to himself silently, and then said;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is one thing I can offer you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The man was interested.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m interested\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFirst off you have to promise not to tell anyone you got it here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAye nae bother!  Let\u2019s see it!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the shopkeeper took the man to the back of the store.  There was a door covered with locks and chains.  Slowly the shopkeeper took off each chain and unlocked each lock.  He then opened the door and revealed a small room.  In a dimly lit corner of the room there was a majestic polar bear, tied up with a chain around it\u2019s neck, breathing heavily as it slept.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBrilliant!\u201d  Exclaimed the man.  \u201cI don\u2019t care fit the price is, I\u2019m having that polar bear!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The man and the shopkeeper did the deal, the man took the polar bear by the rope and started to leave the shop.  Then the shopkeeper shouted at him</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWait!  I almost forgot.  There is one thing you must remember.  Never, ever touch the polar bear on the nose.  God help you if you do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNae problem!\u201d  Said the man as he toddled off.  Don\u2019t touch him on the nose, easy peasy.</p>\n\n<p>So the man walked casually down the street with the polar bear, naebody gave them a second look, people are used to seeing this type of stuff.  They waited at the bus stop, when the bus came he argued with the driver that the polar bear should get on for free.  Begrudgingly paid for himself and the polar bear, took their seats on the bus, and eventually, got home.  The man tied the polar bear up in his kitchen, and stared at the beast in awe.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBrilliant, me and this polar bear are gonna have so much fun.  We\u2019ll go for walks, we\u2019ll play fetch, we\u2019ll have bathtime.  It\u2019ll be great\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The man went to his bed that night dreaming of polar bears.  When he got up in the morning, he ran downstairs to see if the polar bear was up.  He ran into the kitchen but was disappointed to see the polar bear was still fast asleep.  He went back often that day, but the polar bear never awoke.   </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just give him time, maybe he\u2019s tired and needs a rest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The next morning the man awoke and ran to the kitchen.  But the bear was still asleep.  The next morning, the same thing.  The next morning, bear still snoring.  Morning after that, bears sitting there reading the morning paper.  Next morning, bears asleep.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is useless.  What\u2019s the point in having a polar bear if it doesn\u2019t do anything!\u201d  The man exclaimed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI wonder what the shopkeeper meant would happen if I touched it\u2019s nose ...\u201d The man pondered.  It couldn\u2019t be anything that bad.  </p>\n\n<p>Slowly, the man approached the bear.  The bear was snoring heavily, it\u2019s sharp teeth dripping drool from the side of it\u2019s mouth.  The man wiped sweat from his brow as he stood face to face with the beast.  Slowly, he reached out his hand, and tapped the bear on the nose.  </p>\n\n<p>Nothing.  No reaction from the bear whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFit the fu-\u201c</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly the bears eyes opened wide.  It appeared startled at first, but then saw the man.  The bear started to growl, and stood tall, pounding it\u2019s paws of the ground.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAwww, shite!\u201d  said the man as he started to walk towards the door.  All of a sudden the chain ripped from the bears neck.  He was free to charge at the man.  The man turned and ran out of the house, and locked the door behind him.  He was sweating with fear, he could hear the polar bear banging on the other side of the door.  The man considered his options.  He saw his car and decided to jump in and just start driving, he would worry about where he was going later.*</p>\n\n<p>*If at this point in the story you\u2019re wondering why, if the man had a car, he took the bus to the pet shop, it\u2019s because parking prices for the city centre are absolutely extortionate. </p>\n\n<p>The man turned the ignition on, slammed his foot on the pedal, and the car slammed into his house and destroyed his bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShite!\u201d  The man yelled as brown shitey water sprayed from what used to be his toilet all over his car.  \u201cLeft it in fucking reverse!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The man changed gears and drove away.  As he drove he caught a glimpse of the polar bear drinking the brown shitey water from what used to be the toilet.  The man puked a little.</p>\n\n<p>He kept driving, considering where he should go.  \u201cThe airport!  I\u2019ll get away, stay abroad for a few days, wait for the polar bear to wander off, then it will all be fine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The man began to relax, he had it all worked out in his head.  He looked out his rear-view mirror, and his jaw dropped.  He saw running on the road, the polar bear, drool coming from it\u2019s mouth.  The man sped up but the polar bear kept running, it got faster and faster, closer and closer.  The polar bear was in touching distance of the car.  The man suddenly slammed on the breaks, as the car ground to a halt the polar bear ran head first into the bumper and fell back.  The man laughed as he drove away to the airport, leaving the polar bear on the side of the road.</p>\n\n<p>The man got to the airport, ran inside, and looked for the first plane out of the country.  There was a flight departing in 20 minutes for Cuba.  The man went to the counter, pulled out his credit card, and bought a one way ticket.  He went through security, into customs, bought a kit kat, a bottle of Coke, and a Take A Break, and boarded the flight.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be okay.\u201d  The man thought, as he sat at his window seat on the plane.  The plane began to take off, and the man decided it would be nice to have a view of the ground.  He lifted the window blind (you know the shitey wee plastic things you get on a plane) and was terrified to see, on the wing of the plane, the polar bear, with his face pressed up against the window staring at the man.  The man yelped, and pulled the blind back down. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck \u2026\u201d The man thought to himself.  The plane was shaking with the force of taking off.  \u201cit\u2019ll be fine, there is no way he will survive the whole plane journey out there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The plane evened out, and the man slowly opened the blind again, the polar bear was still there, face pressed up against the window.  The man pulled the blind back down again.  \u201cHo-lee-crap.\u201d  The man thought, as he slumped in his seat.  There was nothing that he could do but wait it out.  He kept checking every 10 minutes or so, but every time the bear was still there at the window, face pressed up against the glass, staring at the man.  The man drifted off, and awoke several hours later.  He opened the blind but the bear was still there, staring.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJesus!  That bear is determined!\u201d  The man mumbled.  He felt his stomach rumble.  He looked about for his kit kat but couldn\u2019t see it anywhere.  He peered out the window.  The polar bear was grinning, as it unwrapped the mans kit kat and slowly ate it, savouring every chocolaty bite.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSon of a bitch\u201d The man cursed, under his breath.  He pulled the blind back down and sighed.  He could feel the plane coming in to land.  What was he going to do?  He decided he would just have to get off the plane as fast as possible and run.  As the plane grounded to a stop the man jumped over people, squeezed his way through.  He barged past a young couple, then yelled \u201cPISS OFF!\u201d at an old lady at the front as he knocked her to the ground.  He jumped from the plane and started running.  He heard the thud of the polar bear as it jumped from the wing and started chasing him.  </p>\n\n<p>This was it, the man thought.  He couldn\u2019t get away from the bear.  He couldn\u2019t outrun it.  He didn\u2019t even know where he was going.  He soon found himself at a dead end.  He turned and gulped.  The polar bear stood there, towering over the man.  It had the look of a hunter in it\u2019s eyes, and drool in it\u2019s mouth.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck did I have to tap it on the nose!  The man thought, as the polar bear slowly approached him, growling under it\u2019s breath.  The man felt warm liquid trickle down his leg as he cowered in the corner.  The bear stood over the man, sniffed at him.</p>\n\n<p>The man started to cry.</p>\n\n<p>The polar bear roared.</p>\n\n<p>The man felt excrement build in his pants.</p>\n\n<p>In one swift movement, the polar bear lifted it\u2019s paw high above the man</p>\n\n<p>It brought it\u2019s paw swinging down</p>\n\n<p>The paw connected with the mans shoulder, as the polar bear yelled</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTIG!
