You aren&#39;t a monk.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, then can I become a monk?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?&quot; asked the new monk.</p>\n\n<p>The head monk replied, &quot;The source is too complicated to describe in words.

This key will show you the answer you seek.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door.
