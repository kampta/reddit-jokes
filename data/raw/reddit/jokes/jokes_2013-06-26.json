She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate. Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>One day her \u201clittle\u201d sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn\u2019t overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn\u2019t say a word.</p>\n\n<p>She said, \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!</p>\n\n<p>With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, \u201cWe are very happy that you have passed our little test.
