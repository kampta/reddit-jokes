Wandering about, he notices a panther heading rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch. \n                                                     \n\nThe old German Shepherd thinks, \"Oh, oh! I'm in deep shit now!\" \n                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nNoticing some bones on the ground close by, he immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the panther is about to leap, the old German Shepherd exclaims loudly, \n\n\n\n                   \n\"Boy, that was one delicious panther!  I wonder if there are any more around here?\" \n\n\nHearing this, the young panther halts his attack in mid-strike, a look of terror comes over him and he slinks away into the trees. \n\n\n\n\n\"Whew!,\" says the panther, \"That was close! That old German Shepherd nearly had me!\" \n\n\nMeanwhile, a squirrel who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the panther. So, off he goes. \n\n              \nThe squirrel soon catches up with the panther, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the panther. \n\n\nThe young panther is furious at being made a fool of and says, \"Here, squirrel, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine!\" \n\n\nNow, the old German Shepherd sees the panther coming with the squirrel on his back and thinks, \"What am I going to do now?,\" but instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn't seen them yet, and just when they get close enough to hear, the old German Shepherd says... \n\n\n\n\n\"Where's that squirrel? I sent him off an hour ago to bring me another panther!\" \n\n\nMoral of this story... \n\n                              \nDon't mess with the old dogs.... Age and skill will always overcome youth and treachery! \nBull Shit and brilliance only come with age and experience..
