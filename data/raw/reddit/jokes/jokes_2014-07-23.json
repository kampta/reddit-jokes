Why, what did you wish for?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the bartender is understandably ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship.

But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And then he starts to cry.

You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God.

I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.</p>\n\n<p>And suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.</p>\n\n<p>So the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay.

There, in the corner, there\u2019s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.</p>\n\n<p>So the guy asks the bartender, \u201cWhere\u2019d he come from?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cThere\u2019s a genie in the men\u2019s room who grants wishes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the guy runs into the men\u2019s room and, sure enough, there\u2019s this genie. And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cO.K., I wish for world peace.\u201d And there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and then the room fills up with geese.</p>\n\n<p>So the guy walks out of the men\u2019s room and he\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the guy processes this. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cYeah. Why, what did you wish for?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWorld peace.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So the bartender is understandably ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it\u2019s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI feel like I should explain myself further.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI have what\u2019s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m small down there. I\u2019m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy feels sorry for him. So he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhere do you think that comes from?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn\u2019t tell her. I think it\u2019s wrapped up in that somehow.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHave you ever seen anyone about this?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cListen, I couldn\u2019t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn\u2019t speak the last ten years of his life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, \u201cHe was a total monster.

And he\u2019s, like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m over it. He always said I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I\u2019m a professional musician!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist starts to laugh, but it\u2019s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he\u2019s, like, \u201cWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And then he starts to cry. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cI just wish I\u2019d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And all of a sudden there\u2019s this big cloud of smoke\u2014and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist is, like, \u201cI said \u2018old man,\u2019 not \u2018old van\u2019!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, \u201cYour genie\u2019s hard of hearing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender says, \u201cNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, \u201cOh, my God. You didn\u2019t really want me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d You know, trying to backpedal.</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, \u201cOnce an accident, always an accident.\u201d And he drinks all of his whiskey.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cBrian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cWhoa, calm down.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist is, like, \u201cFuck you!\u201d And he\u2019s really drunk, because he\u2019s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.</p>\n\n<p>And suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.</p>\n\n<p>So the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.</p>\n\n<p>So the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.</p>\n\n<p>And the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer.

Fuck you!\u201d\n\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he\u2019s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender\u2019s arms.\n\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he\u2019s, like, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m just like him. I\u2019m just like him.\u201d And he starts weeping.\n\nAnd the bartender\u2019s, like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnd the pianist is, like, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m worthless!\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, \u201cDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You\u2019re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.\u201d\n\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\n\nSo the guy, who\u2019s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn\u2019t know the bartender was gay. It doesn\u2019t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there\u2019s the genie.\n\nSo the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cWho says they\u2019re broken?\u201d And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\nAnd then the genie says, \u201cThat bartender\u2019s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.\u201d\n\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\n\nAnd the genie\u2019s, like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy\u2019s, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Let\u2019s just grab a beer.
