The building is ours with only minimal damage.\" \n\nAfter a few nods of acknowledgement the Officer for the seals sat down pretty smugly. Then the officer for the Air Force division got up and went on with the briefing.\n\n\"Well um.. our operation was finished on the first day.\" this got a few eyebrows from the marine and Seals officers. \"and out of our team of four, we are glad to say that no one was harmed.\"\n\n\"What did you do, bomb the building with a UAV?\" asked a marine officer.\n\n\"No, part of the requirement was to keep collateral damage to a minimum. And before you say anything else, no ordinance was fired, there were no casualties on both sides, and there was no damage to the building\" This got dead silence from the room at large. \"And they did accept our first offer\" the Air force officer finished with.\n\n\"What was your offer\" The seals officer asked now taking it seriously. After all, they did outperform his unit as far as the numbers went. As the Air Force officer thumbed through the notes, the other officers keenly listened on the edge of their seats.\n\n\"Well, after we pulled up the blueprints, got an idea of the layout, and were able to make the necessary adjustments to our plan. We came to them with an offer of fixed installments for the next 20 years totaling up to 80% of the going market value for the building with options to cash out in one lump sum at 65% if they chose the first option we can get a decent mortage to- *yeah you get where this is going*\n\n\n\nHeard this one from my dad retiree from the Air(chair) Force 30 years (the term he prefers for his occupation was Egghead).
