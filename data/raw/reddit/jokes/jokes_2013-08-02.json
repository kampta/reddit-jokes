The salesman collects his winnings, and is just about to leave when the bartender stops him, \"Look man, that's twice you've won the pot.  How did you do it?\"\n\nThe salesman replies, \"The first time I told the horse my cock was bigger than his.  The second time I showed him.\"\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Bar challenge
