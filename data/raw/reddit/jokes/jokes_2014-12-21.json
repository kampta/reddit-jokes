Actually just between you and me she isn't the most attractive person and doesn't like being gawked at.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I am sorry to hear that sir but be that as it may, shouldn't you spend your last night here with her?\u201d asked the manager.\n\n'Well did I mention she was not all that attractive? I'm afraid this wasn't quite true, she is actually hideous, I'm not sure I could even do the deed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell sir, perhaps with the lights off and a paper bag for good measure might suffice? It is also her honeymoon as well you know.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes but you see\u201d replied the fisherman, \u201cmy bride has a terrible prolapse along with two venereal diseases, I just couldn't\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy goodness\u201d was the response.\n\n\u201cAnd before you say I should turn her around her persistent and sizable hemorrhoids make that an impossibility\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell sir I am indeed struggling, perhaps allowing her to perform fellatio might be an option?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat with all those rotten and chipped teeth, it would be like having oral sex from a shark. Not a chance!\u201d protested the fisherman.\n\n\u201cOuch\u201d came the reply form the manager, \u201cI will admit to being at a loss, is her at least giving you a hand-job out of the question?\u201d\n\n\u201cTotally, the warts and ulcers and chipped nails would see to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm sorry sir but I simply must know, why on earth did you marry her?\u201d asked the manager resignedly.\n\n\u201cWhy for the worms son, for the worms.\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The avid fisherman.
