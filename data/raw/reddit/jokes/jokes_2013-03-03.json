Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper\u2019s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost and, being a typical man, I didn\u2019t stop for directions.\n\nI finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.\n\nI felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I started to play.\n\nThe workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I\u2019ve never played before for this homeless man.\n\nAnd as I played \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019 the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.\n\nAs I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, \u201cI never seen nothin\u2019 like that before and I\u2019ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years.\u201d\n\nGuess I was still lost.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The Bagpiper", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_19j99a", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19j99a/the_bagpiper/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "19j99a", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrCalifornia", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19j99a/the_bagpiper/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1362280199.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19j99a/the_bagpiper/", "created_utc": 1362251399.0, "ups": 2, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This guy walks out of the bathroom when a woman says, &quot;Excuse me sir, but your garage door is open.&quot;\nThe guy then replies, &quot;Oh, really?
