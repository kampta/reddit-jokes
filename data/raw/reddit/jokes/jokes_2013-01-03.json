So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, the old man &quot;Well, I don&#39;t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don&#39;t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except...&quot; and he stopped.&quot; &quot;Except what?&quot; &quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot; &quot;C&#39;mon, tell me !

The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said &quot;Voodoo dick, get back in your box!&quot; The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.

She got it out, and said &quot;Voodoo dick, my pussy!&quot; The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she&#39;d ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she&#39;d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she&#39;d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn&#39;t been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn&#39;t stop screwing.

After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \"Voodoo dick, my pussy!\" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second, and then said: \"Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Voodoo d*ck (potentially NSFW)",
