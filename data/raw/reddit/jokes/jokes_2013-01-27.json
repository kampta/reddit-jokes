They arrive and Timmy gets locked in his cell. He gets out in four years on good behavior.\n  As he leaves the prison, he encounters a middle aged Mexican woman. She asks him what he&#39;s doing.\n  &quot;Well my teacher sent me to the principal&#39;s office and he expelled me. when i got home, my mom sent me to my dad who threw me out on the street where a police officer picked me up and sent me to county court and the county judge sent me to state prison and the state judge sent me to the supreme court and the supreme court justice sent me to Mexican prison for five years but i got out in four for good behavior.&quot;\n  &quot;Well what did you do?&quot;\n  &quot;i&#39;m not sure i wan&#39;t to tell you. i seem to just get in more trouble every time i explain it.&quot;\n  &quot;You can tell me. I won&#39;t tell anybody,&quot; she says.\n  &quot;i said purple flower.&quot;\n  &quot;Oooohh I know all about that.&quot;\n  &quot;So you can tell me what it means?&quot; he asks anxious to know why it&#39;s been causing him so much trouble. The suspense is almost too much for him to handle.\n  &quot;No i can&#39;t tell you,&quot; she says, crushing his hopes, &quot;but i can tell you how to find out.&quot;\n  &quot;Please i&#39;ll do anything.&quot; he says.\n  &quot;So from here you&#39;re going to want to go about a mile down the road, and you&#39;ll come to a fork, stay left and keep on it for a ways. then you take the third left and the second right on that street. You&#39;ll cross a bridge and go immediately right. follow the road by the river until you come to a big building that says &quot;library&quot; on the front. Go inside and on the third floor, aisle &quot;G&quot;, on the fourth shelf you&#39;ll find an old red, worn leather book. Open it and go to page 85. The third paragraph down you&#39;ll find out what purple flower means.\n  So Timmy sets off down the road. About a mile he comes to a fork in the road and stays left. he takes the third left and the second right. he comes to a bridge and crosses it. he walks along the path by the river and across the street he sees a big building that says &quot;library&quot; on the front.

You can come back when you've learned some decency.\" And with that, Timmy was sent to the streets.\n  Just as Timmy was starting to think about what he was going to do, a police officer came up to him and asked \"what are you doing on the street son?\"\n  \"Well my teacher sent me to the principal's office and then i got expelled. When i got home, my mom sent me to my dad who threw me out into the street.\"\n  \"That seems a little harsh,\" said the police officer, \"What did you do to deserve that?\"\n  \"I said purple flower\"\n  \"I won't tolerate that kind of language in my streets! I'm taking you to court.\"\n  So Timmy goes to court, and when he comes in front of the judge, the judge asks \"why are you here?\"\n  \"It's kind of a long story.\"\n  \"I got all the time in the world sonny.\"\n  \"Well, if you must know, my teacher sent me to the principal's office and the principal expelled me. So i went home and my mom sent me to my dad who threw me out on the street which is where the lovely police officer found me and brought me here.\"\n  \"What did you do?\"\n  \"I said purple flower.\"\n  The court is in chaos. The judge bangs her gavel and yells \"I won't tolerate that language in my court house! I'm sending you to state court.\"\n  Timmy reluctantly goes to state court and the judge there says \"why are you here?\"\n  \"Well my teacher sent me to the principal's office and he expelled me. when i got home, my mom sent me to my dad who threw me out on the street where a police officer picked me up and sent me to county court and the county judge sent me here.\"\n  \"What did you do?\"\n  \"I said purple flower\"\n  The reaction of the audience is much the same, there is an uproar and much gavel banging. \"I won't tolerate that language in my court house. I'm sending you to the supreme court.\"\n  Timmy gets on a bus that takes him to the supreme court building. The supreme court justice asks him \"Why are you here?\"\n  Timmy replies \"Well my teacher sent me to the principal's office and he expelled me. when i got home, my mom sent me to my dad who threw me out on the street where a police officer picked me up and sent me to county court and the county judge sent me to state court and the state judge sent me here.\"\n  \"What did you do?\"\n  \"I said purple flower.\"\n  \"I won't tolerate that language in this courthouse. You disgrace your country with your sailors tongue. I sentence you to five years in Mexican prison.\"\n  Timmy gets on a bus with a bunch of other criminals headed to the Mexican prison. They arrive and Timmy gets locked in his cell. He gets out in four years on good behavior.\n  As he leaves the prison, he encounters a middle aged Mexican woman. She asks him what he's doing.\n  \"Well my teacher sent me to the principal's office and he expelled me. when i got home, my mom sent me to my dad who threw me out on the street where a police officer picked me up and sent me to county court and the county judge sent me to state prison and the state judge sent me to the supreme court and the supreme court justice sent me to Mexican prison for five years but i got out in four for good behavior.\"\n  \"Well what did you do?\"\n  \"i'm not sure i wan't to tell you. i seem to just get in more trouble every time i explain it.\"\n  \"You can tell me. I won't tell anybody,\" she says.\n  \"i said purple flower.\"\n  \"Oooohh I know all about that.\"\n  \"So you can tell me what it means?\" he asks anxious to know why it's been causing him so much trouble. The suspense is almost too much for him to handle.\n  \"No i can't tell you,\" she says, crushing his hopes, \"but i can tell you how to find out.\"\n  \"Please i'll do anything.\" he says.\n  \"So from here you're going to want to go about a mile down the road, and you'll come to a fork, stay left and keep on it for a ways. then you take the third left and the second right on that street. You'll cross a bridge and go immediately right. follow the road by the river until you come to a big building that says \"library\" on the front. Go inside and on the third floor, aisle \"G\", on the fourth shelf you'll find an old red, worn leather book. Open it and go to page 85. The third paragraph down you'll find out what purple flower means.\n  So Timmy sets off down the road. About a mile he comes to a fork in the road and stays left. he takes the third left and the second right. he comes to a bridge and crosses it. he walks along the path by the river and across the street he sees a big building that says \"library\" on the front. He takes two eager steps across the street and gets hit by a bus.
