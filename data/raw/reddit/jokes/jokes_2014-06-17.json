He doesn&#39;t mind it much, except for the fact that every year when the circus comes to town, he never gets to see it. The years pass and every year he watches the circus come and go with a tear in his eye. Then one year as the circus is leaving, he snaps. &quot;Fuck it,&quot; he says.&quot; I&#39;m going to get myself a job so I can see the circus.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The next day he applies for a job at a supermarket stacking shelves. He gets this job and works his heart out. He works every night stacking shelves, earning money. He spends very little, and saves heaps. He is the best worker the supermarket has ever seen.

It&#39;s a packed house and the buzz is electric. The dancing horses come out, then the elephants, then everyone&#39;s favorite, the clowns.
