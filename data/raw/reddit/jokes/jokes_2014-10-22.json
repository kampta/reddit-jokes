I swear to god there&#39;s no loch ness monster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benny and the Urn</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time a man named Benny was living in ancient Mesopotamia. A miner by trade, one day he discovered a secret cavern filled with jewels, gold, and piled high with priceless artifacts.</p>\n\n<p>The floor was covered with golden jars, urns that were formed from solid gold. They were each the size of a man&#39;s heart, carved with runic symbols and the air around which shimmered and pulsed as if alive. But the real prize was atop the pile of loot, nestled in a case lined with red velvet; a golden oil lamp, etched with markings and symbols older than time. </p>\n\n<p>No sooner did Benny take it into his hand than a swirling tornado erupted from its spout. The light from his single torch seemed to falter, then blazed anew as the tornado calmed. When the dust had cleared, a strange man stood before him, clothed in gold with his arms folded across his bronze chest. He spoke with a rumbling voice that could not be ignored.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You have released me from my ten-thousand-year imprisonment, and in gratitude I will grant you a single wish. Choose wisely.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Benny thought for a long while, and when he had weighed the options he asked for immortality, that single unobtainable goal that all men strive for.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Everlasting life will I grant you,&quot; said the Genie, &quot;But on one condition. You must swear by the life you will owe me that you will never again shave the hair of your face or head, never for all eternity. Do this, and eternal life shall be yours. Do not, and your soul is forfeit, and you will join the many that failed and in turn have been imprisoned here.&quot; He gestures around at the urns that cover the floor of the cavern. The air around each shimmered and pulsed silently. </p>\n\n<p>Of course Benny agrees, and the Genie vanishes in a puff of gold dust, leaving all the wealth of the chamber behind for the taking. </p>\n\n<p>Benny rushes into the city and buys the land containing the cavern of riches and overnight becomes the most famous and wealthy man in the realm. He gives up mining and buys a fleet of trading ships, not only to grow his wealth but to spread the tale of Benny and the Lamp across the seas and to distant lands, the better to see his own self last through the ages. </p>\n\n<p>As time passes, and his beard grows longer, he notices the passage of time more distinctly. His parents die, his brothers and sisters, all fabulously rich and comfortable, but their passing is no less sorrowful to him.\nWhen his wife and the last of his children are in their graves, he swears to continue his life for as long as the Genie&#39;s spell could prolong it, spreading his wealth amongst the people in honor of the family he&#39;d outlived.

I swear to god there's no loch ness monster.\n\n**Benny and the Urn**\n\nOnce upon a time a man named Benny was living in ancient Mesopotamia. A miner by trade, one day he discovered a secret cavern filled with jewels, gold, and piled high with priceless artifacts.\n\nThe floor was covered with golden jars, urns that were formed from solid gold. They were each the size of a man's heart, carved with runic symbols and the air around which shimmered and pulsed as if alive. But the real prize was atop the pile of loot, nestled in a case lined with red velvet; a golden oil lamp, etched with markings and symbols older than time. \n\nNo sooner did Benny take it into his hand than a swirling tornado erupted from its spout. The light from his single torch seemed to falter, then blazed anew as the tornado calmed. When the dust had cleared, a strange man stood before him, clothed in gold with his arms folded across his bronze chest. He spoke with a rumbling voice that could not be ignored.\n\n\"You have released me from my ten-thousand-year imprisonment, and in gratitude I will grant you a single wish. Choose wisely.\"\n\nBenny thought for a long while, and when he had weighed the options he asked for immortality, that single unobtainable goal that all men strive for.\n \n\"Everlasting life will I grant you,\" said the Genie, \"But on one condition. You must swear by the life you will owe me that you will never again shave the hair of your face or head, never for all eternity. Do this, and eternal life shall be yours. Do not, and your soul is forfeit, and you will join the many that failed and in turn have been imprisoned here.\" He gestures around at the urns that cover the floor of the cavern. The air around each shimmered and pulsed silently. \n\nOf course Benny agrees, and the Genie vanishes in a puff of gold dust, leaving all the wealth of the chamber behind for the taking. \n\nBenny rushes into the city and buys the land containing the cavern of riches and overnight becomes the most famous and wealthy man in the realm. He gives up mining and buys a fleet of trading ships, not only to grow his wealth but to spread the tale of Benny and the Lamp across the seas and to distant lands, the better to see his own self last through the ages. \n\nAs time passes, and his beard grows longer, he notices the passage of time more distinctly. His parents die, his brothers and sisters, all fabulously rich and comfortable, but their passing is no less sorrowful to him.\nWhen his wife and the last of his children are in their graves, he swears to continue his life for as long as the Genie's spell could prolong it, spreading his wealth amongst the people in honor of the family he'd outlived.
