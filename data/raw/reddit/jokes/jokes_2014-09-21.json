The grandfather cooks up the bass from the morning and puts on the radio for a little while. \n\nWhen they sit down to eat the well seasoned bass, the boy exclaims, \"Eww grandpa, these plates are disgusting!\" \n\nThe grandfather, now fed up with his grandson's tone replies, \"How many times do I have to tell you? They're as clean as cold water can get them! Now sit down and eat!\" \n\nThe boy reluctantly eats his meal and afterwards goes outside on the deck where his grandfather is already smoking his nightly cigar.\n\nThe two are standing quietly looking up at the night sky when suddenly the grandfather's beagle comes running up and starts humping the boy's leg. \n\nThe grandfather swats the dog and yells, \"God dammit Cold Water, get down off him!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The fishing trip", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2h16o2", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2h16o2/the_fishing_trip/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2h16o2", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "apatheticus", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2h16o2/the_fishing_trip/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1411335222.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2h16o2/the_fishing_trip/", "created_utc": 1411306422.0, "ups": 7, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My teacher pointed me with her ruler and declared that at the end of her ruler is an idiot.\nI was suspended for a week for just asking which end!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "My teacher pointed me with her ruler and declared that at the end of her ruler is an idiot.\nI was suspended for a week for just asking which end!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Do you know which End she was talking about?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2h0y7u", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2h0y7u/do_you_know_which_end_she_was_talking_about/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2h0y7u", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sqageek", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2h0y7u/do_you_know_which_end_she_was_talking_about/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1411325994.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2h0y7u/do_you_know_which_end_she_was_talking_about/", "created_utc": 1411297194.0, "ups": 7, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The fairy flies around a bit among the tourists before stopping in front of two classical and gorgeous greek statues placed beside each other - one being a scantily clad and muscled Apollo and the other beautiful and busty Aphrodite, the goddess of love and sex.</p>\n\n<p>The fairy looks on these two beautiful creations for a moment and with a smile and a wave of her wand the statues suddenly come alive!</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Dear beautiful couple!&quot; the fairy says.  &quot;You have been standing here motionless on your pedestals for thousands of years among the birds, through wind and rain and never been able to touch each other.
