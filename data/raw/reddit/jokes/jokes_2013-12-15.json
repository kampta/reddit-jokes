It was still early in the morning and he ended up falling asleep while he was doing his business. Meanwhile, Bill killed a deer and had field dressed it. He went to check on the Bob and found him sleeping, with his ass hanging over a stump. He thought that he would put one over on his friend, so he put the entrails from the deer under his friends ass and went back to camp. \n\nA few hours go by and Bob comes back to camp and he's visibly shaken up. \"What's wrong?\" Bill asked. \n\nBob said, \"You'll never believe it. I just shit my guts out back there in the woods.\"\n\nBill said, \"Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital?\"\n\nBob replied, \"No, I think I'll be alright. I found a stick and poked them all back up in there.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Hunter nearly kills himself.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1sx1xo", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1sx1xo/hunter_nearly_kills_himself/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1sx1xo", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "supergordo", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 116, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1sx1xo/hunter_nearly_kills_himself/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1387115140.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1sx1xo/hunter_nearly_kills_himself/", "created_utc": 1387086340.0, "ups": 116, "num_comments": 11}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I went up to a child and asked him &quot;what is the best gift one can get for Christmas?&quot; Just before he could answer I chimed in and shouted &quot;Your mom!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I was abruptly kicked out of the orphanage.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "I went up to a child and asked him \"what is the best gift one can get for Christmas?\" Just before he could answer I chimed in and shouted \"Your mom!\"\n\nI was abruptly kicked out of the orphanage.
