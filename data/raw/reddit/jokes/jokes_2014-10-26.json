With this in mind, lets take a look at the different types of seniors we meet. I&#39;ve had the chance to speak with many types of seniors while working at a call center, here is a list of a few of em... </p>\n\n<p>Senior Lonely.   These seniors tend to call in around the holidays or weekends.  They talk to you as though you are a long lost friend not caring about the fact they don&#39;t know you. Be prepared to listen to all their senior related problems.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Heavy Breather.  These seniors, whether mean or nice tend to breathe really heavy on the phone. Most don\u2019t realize it and most won\u2019t do anything about it if you tell them.   Be prepared to put them on hold a lot to give your ears a break.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Fat Fingers.  These seniors tend to be angry at the world because it seems JUST too small to put their finger on. Be prepared for such things as \u201c this phone won\u2019t dial correctly\u201d Or \u201cthese buttons are too small!!\u201d    There really is no remedy for this other than suggesting a pencil and a magnifying glass. Most of these seniors suffer from arthritis </p>\n\n<p>Senior Grumpy:  These seniors call in grumpy and require much attention to detail to win them over. Mostly the issue they call about can be traced back to either not knowing how to, or forgetting what they did do </p>\n\n<p>Senior Happy:  These seniors are happy and can almost be counted on to tell you how wonderful life is.  Whether on vacation 50 times a year OR happy your service is cheep these seniors will add a smile to your face.   Be grateful for them!!</p>\n\n<p>Senior know it all: These seniors seem to know the answer before even giving you their account number.  These seniors will use antiquated or nonsense terms like \u2018 Digital analog\u201d to describe a cell phone they were shown just yesterday and how its better than the GSM phone you provide. They will also argue and demand 100% Proof that the .25 cent call made from their phone was indeed\u2026 Made from their phone.   Be happy they don\u2019t have your home address</p>\n\n<p>Senior Frisky: If you are a desperate agent you might wish these seniors were 25 years old, as they tend to want to flirt with you.  This stems in part from loneliness and well\u2026.. friskiness!!!. Most are harmless flirt types but just watch out for Senior Hard core!!</p>\n\n<p>Senior Hard Core:  These seniors Stress Everything they say. If they are angry, they stress that to you verbally. If they are flirting, they stress that as well. Everything to the extreme. They can turn a small thing into a huge problem.  Be happy for the times they stress how glad they are to have talked to you..</p>\n\n<p>Senior Stumper:  These seniors can vary from innocently making a point or backing a newer rep in the corner with an obscure point as to why they should get a credit or not pay their bill. Most can be disarmed by looking over their bill. The rest will continue to try to stump you on everything they ask with regards to their account.  The best defense is a good offense, just have a polite game plan. </p>\n\n<p>Senior PMS:  These seniors seem to almost always wake up on the wrong side of the couch or call in with a back ache from falling asleep in the lazy boy chair while watching A Lawrence Whelk special.  Most will be moody and short tempered and sound slightly slobbery when calling in.   Just be nice and straight to the point when helping them. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Quote: These seniors never say anything on their own, they must always quote others or obscure things that \u201csomeone else\u201d has told them. Most of the time it takes a little coxing to get their issue resolved.  Be sure to always give them correct information, least they quote you to the next rep. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Blame Others:  These seniors live by the motto \u201cWhy blame yourself if you can blame others\u201d. In dealing with these seniors, be sensitive and follow their lead. Just point out the mistakes (the other person made) and correct them but be sure to say\u201d the other person should have told you\u201d blah blah.   Be happy and positive with these seniors.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Long talker: These seniors will talk until out of breath and turning purple. They will carry a conversation that would normally take 5 minutes to a whole day if they could. You must be firm in dealing with these seniors. Be sure to assist them but be firm and to the point. You will need to keep them on track with issue at hand.  These seniors will gladly offer free lectures!!</p>\n\n<p>Senior inquisitor: These seniors are almost always on the high horse. Sitting high and talking down to you. These seniors think they have everything already worked out and are just testing you\u2026 Waiting for you to give the wrong answer.   Trick is to not be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Show off: These seniors love to remind younger people that although they are no longer young, they have a fancy home, yacht and a car you can only dream of. Most of these seniors are harmless unless they feel threatened that you may have more than them. \nI\u2019ve found the best way to diffuse these seniors is to go along and stoke their ego by saying \u201cGreat, You earned it\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Senior No Clue: These seniors really have no clue and are not afraid to admit it. Unlike other seniors who get embarrassed, these seniors openly admit they need help. Be happy when helping these seniors, they really need it.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Dispute: These seniors call just to argue. It does not even have to be about their service. They call just to pick a fight and dispute what ever you tell them.  \u201c the world if round\u201d  or \u201c The sky is blue\u201d no worries, they will dispute that as well.  These really is no pleasing them. Just concede the point and get off the phone asap.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Instigator: These seniors will start off the conversation peaceful enough just to hide their true intentions. They will usually insult your intelligence in order to start a problem.  Be it a true fact or some made up point, they will insult you to no end or until they are too tired to carry on.   Just take what they say with a grain of salt. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Whinny: These seniors almost always originate from New York or Kentucky. They will almost always start off the conversation whining about how bad the service is and how they have a bill due.  There is no advice I can give on these senior types as it tends to be location based. </p>\n\n<p>Senior I didn\u2019t do it: \u201cSorry I did not make that phone call, I don\u2019t know who did\u201d. These seniors will almost always deny their actions and will always demand proof. \nThe best way to deal with them is to call the number they said they did not dial and find out it was a call to their grandson\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Super security: These seniors will always refuse to give the last 4 digits of their social security number. Even though they gave it to you to open an account. They will offer 101 excuses as to why they should not give it. Just politely remind them its needed to access their account.  It may take 30 minutes of reminding them\u2026  The longest recorded incident was almost 55 minutes!!!</p>\n\n<p>Senior wisdom: These seniors are always wonderful to assist. Towards the end of the call they will generally change the subject and offer some friendly advice, which for the most part you can use in your daily life.  Great people are always wonderful to talk to.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Techno Babble:  Cell phone becomes mobile communications device and Car charger becomes mobile power charging device for phones. Whether a different longer way of saying it or a senior made up word, these seniors pride them selves on knowing what\u2019s what. No sense in correcting them. If you do, they may become Senior Grumpy:</p>\n\n<p>Senior Political:  Whether getting angry with Roosevelt raising taxes or actually talking about politics in this decade, these seniors will never hesitate to share their political views with you. They take pride in themselves that  they have a captive audience to spout politics to. Just don\u2019t say anything, pretend it\u2019s a bad dream\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Indirect: You hardly every get to talk to these seniors. They always have a son or daughter call in to take care of their business. When verifying the account you can always hear them in the background feeding needed information to their children to give to the rep.  In some rare cases the children may get upset or tired and ask to have you talk to their parent. When directly addressing Senior Indirect be sure to be supportive of their needs. Most of the time it\u2019s to cancel service. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Tough Talker:  If words were muscles, these seniors would be about 15 feet tall and weigh 900 pounds (full muscle) Usually when reps don\u2019t do something that Senior \nTough Talker wants they will threaten to call the Attorney general, alert the FBI and call Homeland security because of the 25 cent charge on their bill.  Don\u2019t feed into them or be scared, just patch them to a supervisor.  Supervisors make more money than you for a reason. </p>\n\n<p>Senior No Fair: Any time you have a special for new customers Senior No fair Will call in.  Be it a free phone case or 10 dollars less on your first bill, these seniors will call in and demand the same treatment and discount.  There is so few of these seniors its actually a good thing to just give it to them. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Quizzer:  (special Senior) This is a name of a senior I dealt with. She questioned every little aspect and was quite rude. She would quiz me on things I told her earlier in the conversation. Grab a note pad and take notes because Senior Quizzer is most likely doing the same. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Credit Fisher: These seniors are usually long time customers and only call in with minor problems. This is just the lure though; most of the time they play it out like a huge issue. \u201c My phone is broken\u201d (rep) \u201cPlease hold red button down\u201d (Senior)\u201d Oh it works now\u201d \u201c I need a credit for this though\u201d Senior Credit Fisher will try or say anything it takes to get credit on their bill.   If it\u2019s small just give it to them and save yourself a headache </p>\n\n<p>Senior Health Talker:  Whether it\u2019s the Boils on the bottom of their feet to the violent bowel movements they experience after eating out at a Mexican restaurant. These seniors will never hesitate to tell you about it.  Some senior heavy breathers have been known to talk about health issues when confronted about their heavy breathing. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Shaken voice: These seniors will talk in a very shaken voice. They may sound like Senior Helpless or Senior Indirect but these seniors don\u2019t mind being upfront and confronting their issues head on.  Nor are they helpless.  They are quite harmless to deal with. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Fixed Income:  These seniors live month to month and have no qualms about letting you know that. Typically they can just be good honest seniors looking to save money or a Senior Credit Fisher in disguise using \u201c fixed income \u201cas an excuse or ploy. \nMost of the time it\u2019s just an honest senior looking to save money. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Old Speaker:  These seniors will use old terms like That\u2019s \u201c Trick\u201d or \u201c don\u2019t be a square\u201d Another one is when they say they had to pay \u201c two bits\u201d  Old speakers tend to think about the past and don\u2019t care much for today\u2019s way of saying things. Old speakers are generally harmless, and don&#39;t mind taking the opportunity to tell you how much \u201c two bits \u201c is in todays speak.  Just assist them using normal talk. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Rusher: You would think the way these seniors rush you through the call they had a hot date at the senior center dance meet. No worries, these seniors are determined to stay active, healthy and young. Don\u2019t take it personal; they do that with everything in life. Just pace yourself and help them out. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Squabbles:  These seniors put up mild arguments about things ranging from their monthly statement to when they used the phone last. Senior Squabbles are typically weak willed and just simply like to argue in a mild manner.  Just roll with it\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Life Story: These seniors tell some of their life stories. Whether it\u2019s something interesting or something along the lines of what they did to their Aunt Sally pet bullfrog back in 1934. You can always count on some interesting story that has nothing to do with why they called in.   Some of their stories are actually neat to hear\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Freebie: These seniors are excellent at sniffing out any free offers they can come across. Almost all conversations will lead to getting something free. Unlike Senior Fixed Income &amp; Senior Credit Fisher these seniors just want something free.  They can be rich or poor it does not matter.  Offer them a free pamphlet with our newest merchandise. </p>\n\n<p>Senior Fancy words: Senior fancy words likes to at least 2-3 old time words per conversation. They pride them selves on knowing such words and often enjoy telling you what that means.  Most of the time they give a slight pause to let the word soak in and see if you know what it means.   The best remedy for this is to have Google at hand. If your quick enough you can give a quick response with the meaning of the word. This usually throws Senior Fancy words for a loop and they will quickly end the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Braggart: Unlike other seniors who brag about very specific things, these seniors will brag about almost anything. Killed a stray rat with my walker to bragging about how they found a new way to deal with junk mail, these seniors will be sure to let you know!!!</p>\n\n<p>Senior No credit:  These seniors have spent their entire life using cash and have no built credit. Sadly when it comes time for a credit check they won\u2019t pass.  I always hated telling these seniors that I could not open an account\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Whiz: These seniors first off know just about everything about their service. They know their mobile numbers, rate plans and billing cycle. They even know how to dial AAA using the quick dial. They usually call in to go over things they already know just to impress you on how great of a customer they are.  Chances  are Senior Whiz will remember who they dealt with last\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Clarification:  These seniors require clarification on everything you tell them about their plan. They also tend to call in weekly or Bi Weekly for further clarifications on what they are signed up for, monthly cost etc.  These are our bread and butter customers who keep us busy!!!</p>\n\n<p>Senior Check up: These seniors sort of display behaviors associated with Senior Indirect: and Senior Insecure: However they have no problem dealing directly with you. The main thing that sets these seniors apart from other seniors is they will always call back and ask that rep if the last rep did what they wanted. Most often confirming what the last rep did or said will end the call, however Senior Check Up can very quickly become a Senior Instigator if they feel in a rotten mood.  No advice for you on these seniors except make sure you notate the account and do exactly what you told them you would do for them.        </p>\n\n<p>Senior Feel Sorry for me: These seniors play the victim and put on a sad act. Their act is to make you think they need to cancel. Most of the time they will manipulate a conversation and try to make you feel like you are the one that  backed them into a corner to quit service. They give pauses hoping you will save them with phone credits or free stuff. These seniors usually call back and speak to another rep to restart service for a few months before repeating the Feel sorry for me cycle.  Really you can&#39;t help them as this may happen to 1 in every 50 seniors!!</p>\n\n<p>Senior Favorite Rep: These seniors feel as though they have built a reputation with a certain rep and thus by only speaking to that rep will in turn receive better service or special breaks ie:  credits, special rates etc.  Nothing short of a miracle will get Senior Favorite Rep to talk with a different rep.  I\u2019ve found it easier just to get them to whom they want to speak with</p>\n\n<p>Senior Rude Behavior:  These seniors typically display rude behavior that\u2019s not always directed at the rep. Be it a senior belch or a slow paced tinkle in the potty, these seniors are oblivious that you can hear what\u2019s going on in the background. Most seniors are nice to you but just display behaviors that are best left in private.   Don\u2019t tell them you can hear, they will get embarrassed </p>\n\n<p>Senior Ghost Caller: That\u2019s not a prank phone call, its just gramps talking about grandma to his best friend while his cell phone is in his back pocket!!! Seems all them calls he never makes are because he sits on his cell phone. Just note the account for the next rep and hang up\u2026 </p>\n\n<p>Senior Insecure: These seniors require special handling when working with them on their account.  They really don\u2019t want the service but they know that as soon as they drop it they will need it right away. They hang on by the thread and are never sure about what to do. Just take them by the hand and make them feel good about their service</p>\n\n<p>Senior Multiple Speak: These seniors have a million things racing thru their mind (which I suppose keeps them going) but its when they talk that you can quickly become confused. They tend to ask a question followed by another question followed by a statement followed by another question combined with a statement that often has nothing to do with why they called in the first place.   They may be a hassle for you but let them vent it all out than inform them you are not as fast as they are and will need to handle one issue at one time</p>\n\n<p>Senior New Age: These are people who have just reached the 65 mark and really are in touch with the goings of today\u2019s society. They may display any of the typical senior behaviors but are more confident when doing so (with the exception to senior indirect and other timid senior   behaviors) Just usher these new seniors in and be nice..</p>\n\n<p>Senior Denial:  If these seniors lost 1 year for every time they denied their age they would be about \u201350 years old.   They sometimes flex their voice to sound younger and hate giving their Date of Birth for credit checks and such.  NOTE: If a senior Denial gives the last 4 of the social but not the Date of birth you can be sure it\u2019s a Senior Denial and not a Senior Super Security!!   Just follow the rules for credit checks\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior My Way:  These seniors almost always try to buck the system using their own methods and reasoning. You are always expected to go along with their way of doing things.  Whether its them saying they paid ahead and expecting you to agree and confirm with them what they said is true.  When really they paid current and past due amount. \nJust keep repeating in your head\u2026 I\u2019m not going crazy, I\u2019m not going crazy</p>\n\n<p>Senior They Said: This is not to be confused with Senior Stumper or Senior Quote; these seniors have no qualms about making up a full fledge fib. Always quoting that imaginary person \u2018 they \u201c these seniors will say anything to prove to you that what                \u201c they\u201d told them is correct.  Just tell them that \u201cthey\u201d was wrong\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Drama:  Forget that grandma Lulu lost gramps to a 20-year-old women. Forget that during the senior dance fest grandma was dancing too close to the DJ!! . These seniors love to cause drama with every breath they take.  Typically these seniors are taking care of their grand children because their son or daughter decided it was too hard. These seniors are typically on a fixed income but always manage to get by. They may exhibit behaviors often associated with Senior Low Income or Senior My Way. \nThey will almost always tell you about the grandchildren\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Smoker: Is that Grandpa or Grandma? I can\u2019t tell!!! Who knows because it\u2019s Senior Smoker!!  These seniors are always mellow unless they call before the morning cigarette and cup of coffee. It\u2019s best to get their name first!! Never assume it\u2019s a man or women\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Identifier: These seniors always get the first word in and always start out by identifying themselves. Rep: Thank you for calling consumer.. Senior Identifier: Hello this is John Smith I have an account with you and I am also a AAA member for 30 years. My address is\u2026 My home state is\u2026  Senior Identifier almost always never starts off with the correct information needed ie; Account number or 10-digit cell phone number.  Just allow them to babble and act as though it means something, than politely ask for the 10-digit cell or account number.</p>\n\n<p>Senior Distractions: Whether its the 24-hour Bingo channel blaring in the background or gramps playing with his false teeth   Senior Distractions will always have a distraction for you when calling in.  Just try to ignore the distractions and go about helping them. Senior Distractions can sometimes become angry and feel like you are ignoring them\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior Heavy Thought: Forget asking questions, these seniors will ponder for minutes what you tell them. They will use their own logic and reasoning to decipher what you tell them.  After several minutes of thinking Senior Heavy Thought: will finally come up with a course of action or request they want you to consider / do for them.  Just grab a book while you wait...</p>\n\n<p>Senior One Liner:  These seniors (typically males) will always have that one line they want to say before the call ends. Most of the time its an opening or closing line. Sometimes it requires the conversation to be lead to a subject where the senior can pop off his or her one line.  Senior one liner will feel as though their call went sour if they are not allowed to pop off their one line.   Senior One Liners are easy to work with after they have said their one liner\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Senior call a lot:  These seniors call in a lot just for the sake of feeling busy and or important.  Not really having a good reason to call they often can be spotted checking their minutes or going over their rate plan. They typically call in 2-3 times a or1-2 times daily.. Senior Call a lot is easy to work with most of the time\u2026 </p>\n\n<p>Senior Vocabulary and phrases that will help you understand senior speak. </p>\n\n<p>Mobile Communication Device:  This is senior techno babble for Cell Phone. </p>\n\n<p>Let me think about this: A senior\u2019s way of saying I don\u2019t get my social security until the 3rd of the month. </p>\n\n<p>I did not make that call: This is a senior\u2019s way of saying \u201cI don\u2019t remember making that call\u201d</p>\n\n<p>My phone is not old, I\u2019ve only had it 5 Years: This is a seniors way of saying \u201c My phone should not warring down until its physically broken\u201d OR  \u201c I hate the thought of having to buy another phone\u201d</p>\n\n<p>These buttons are too small: A Seniors way of saying, \u201cMy eye sight is poor\u201d OR \u201cI have big fingers and can\u2019t dial numbers correctly\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I did not use the service that month:  In Senior speak this means \u201cI should not have to pay since I did not use the phone\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m a long time customer: This means \u201cI expect good service and any special discount you haves\u201d   </p>\n\n<p>My phone is broken: This could mean anything from \u201c I don\u2019t know how to turn my phone on and am embarrassed to admit it\u201d OR\u201d I don\u2019t know how to call out but this is my indirect way of asking for help\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t call my self: (when being asked for the 10-digit cell number) This is senior speak for \u201cI can\u2019t remember my cell number because I never use it\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This instruction Book you sent is worthless:  \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about my cell phone and am hinting at needing help with my phone \u201c</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll get my grandkids to help me with this: In senior speak this means,  \u201c I am still not understanding you and need to see how to do this\u201d OR \u201c I am tired and want to get off the phone\u201d\nI need to return this phone: most commonly this is the senior way of saying \u201c I want to cancel service\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I need go over my bill: Another senior way of saying \u201c I don\u2019t understand why my bill is this much\u201d OR  \u201c There\u2019s numbers on here I don\u2019t remember calling but I am too embarrassed to admit I can\u2019t remember so I am going to deny I made these calls\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Seniors are sure a mixed lot that requires special treatment, when dealing with seniors remember that they over all have a right to be respected and their issue handled. How you handle the issue depends on the senior type. With this senior spotting guide I hope you can spot the different seniors and know ahead of time how to handle them. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Seniors, we love em and interact with them every day. With this in mind, lets take a look at the different types of seniors we meet. I've had the chance to speak with many types of seniors while working at a call center, here is a list of a few of em... \n\nSenior Lonely.

These seniors tend to be angry at the world because it seems JUST too small to put their finger on. Be prepared for such things as \u201c this phone won\u2019t dial correctly\u201d Or \u201cthese buttons are too small!!\u201d    There really is no remedy for this other than suggesting a pencil and a magnifying glass. Most of these seniors suffer from arthritis \n\n\nSenior Grumpy:  These seniors call in grumpy and require much attention to detail to win them over.

Be happy they don\u2019t have your home address\n\nSenior Frisky: If you are a desperate agent you might wish these seniors were 25 years old, as they tend to want to flirt with you.

The best defense is a good offense, just have a polite game plan. \n\n\n\nSenior PMS:  These seniors seem to almost always wake up on the wrong side of the couch or call in with a back ache from falling asleep in the lazy boy chair while watching A Lawrence Whelk special.

Just take what they say with a grain of salt. \n\n\nSenior Whinny: These seniors almost always originate from New York or Kentucky. They will almost always start off the conversation whining about how bad the service is and how they have a bill due.  There is no advice I can give on these senior types as it tends to be location based. \n\nSenior I didn\u2019t do it: \u201cSorry I did not make that phone call, I don\u2019t know who did\u201d. These seniors will almost always deny their actions and will always demand proof. \nThe best way to deal with them is to call the number they said they did not dial and find out it was a call to their grandson\u2026\n\nSenior Super security: These seniors will always refuse to give the last 4 digits of their social security number. Even though they gave it to you to open an account. They will offer 101 excuses as to why they should not give it. Just politely remind them its needed to access their account.  It may take 30 minutes of reminding them\u2026  The longest recorded incident was almost 55 minutes!!!\n\nSenior wisdom: These seniors are always wonderful to assist. Towards the end of the call they will generally change the subject and offer some friendly advice, which for the most part you can use in your daily life.  Great people are always wonderful to talk to.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Techno Babble:  Cell phone becomes mobile communications device and Car charger becomes mobile power charging device for phones. Whether a different longer way of saying it or a senior made up word, these seniors pride them selves on knowing what\u2019s what. No sense in correcting them. If you do, they may become Senior Grumpy:\n\n\nSenior Political:  Whether getting angry with Roosevelt raising taxes or actually talking about politics in this decade, these seniors will never hesitate to share their political views with you. They take pride in themselves that  they have a captive audience to spout politics to. Just don\u2019t say anything, pretend it\u2019s a bad dream\u2026\n\n\nSenior Indirect: You hardly every get to talk to these seniors. They always have a son or daughter call in to take care of their business. When verifying the account you can always hear them in the background feeding needed information to their children to give to the rep.  In some rare cases the children may get upset or tired and ask to have you talk to their parent. When directly addressing Senior Indirect be sure to be supportive of their needs. Most of the time it\u2019s to cancel service. \n\n\nSenior Tough Talker:  If words were muscles, these seniors would be about 15 feet tall and weigh 900 pounds (full muscle) Usually when reps don\u2019t do something that Senior \nTough Talker wants they will threaten to call the Attorney general, alert the FBI and call Homeland security because of the 25 cent charge on their bill.  Don\u2019t feed into them or be scared, just patch them to a supervisor.  Supervisors make more money than you for a reason. \n\n\nSenior No Fair: Any time you have a special for new customers Senior No fair Will call in.  Be it a free phone case or 10 dollars less on your first bill, these seniors will call in and demand the same treatment and discount.  There is so few of these seniors its actually a good thing to just give it to them. \n\n\n\n Senior Quizzer:  (special Senior) This is a name of a senior I dealt with. She questioned every little aspect and was quite rude. She would quiz me on things I told her earlier in the conversation. Grab a note pad and take notes because Senior Quizzer is most likely doing the same. \n\n\nSenior Credit Fisher: These seniors are usually long time customers and only call in with minor problems. This is just the lure though; most of the time they play it out like a huge issue. \u201c My phone is broken\u201d (rep) \u201cPlease hold red button down\u201d (Senior)\u201d Oh it works now\u201d \u201c I need a credit for this though\u201d Senior Credit Fisher will try or say anything it takes to get credit on their bill.   If it\u2019s small just give it to them and save yourself a headache \n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Health Talker:  Whether it\u2019s the Boils on the bottom of their feet to the violent bowel movements they experience after eating out at a Mexican restaurant. These seniors will never hesitate to tell you about it.  Some senior heavy breathers have been known to talk about health issues when confronted about their heavy breathing. \n\n\n\nSenior Shaken voice: These seniors will talk in a very shaken voice. They may sound like Senior Helpless or Senior Indirect but these seniors don\u2019t mind being upfront and confronting their issues head on.  Nor are they helpless.  They are quite harmless to deal with. \n\n\n\nSenior Fixed Income:  These seniors live month to month and have no qualms about letting you know that. Typically they can just be good honest seniors looking to save money or a Senior Credit Fisher in disguise using \u201c fixed income \u201cas an excuse or ploy. \nMost of the time it\u2019s just an honest senior looking to save money. \n\n\n\nSenior Old Speaker:  These seniors will use old terms like That\u2019s \u201c Trick\u201d or \u201c don\u2019t be a square\u201d Another one is when they say they had to pay \u201c two bits\u201d  Old speakers tend to think about the past and don\u2019t care much for today\u2019s way of saying things. Old speakers are generally harmless, and don't mind taking the opportunity to tell you how much \u201c two bits \u201c is in todays speak.  Just assist them using normal talk. \n\n\nSenior Rusher: You would think the way these seniors rush you through the call they had a hot date at the senior center dance meet. No worries, these seniors are determined to stay active, healthy and young. Don\u2019t take it personal; they do that with everything in life. Just pace yourself and help them out. \n\n\nSenior Squabbles:  These seniors put up mild arguments about things ranging from their monthly statement to when they used the phone last. Senior Squabbles are typically weak willed and just simply like to argue in a mild manner.  Just roll with it\u2026\n\n\n\nSenior Life Story: These seniors tell some of their life stories. Whether it\u2019s something interesting or something along the lines of what they did to their Aunt Sally pet bullfrog back in 1934. You can always count on some interesting story that has nothing to do with why they called in.   Some of their stories are actually neat to hear\u2026\n\n\n \nSenior Freebie: These seniors are excellent at sniffing out any free offers they can come across. Almost all conversations will lead to getting something free. Unlike Senior Fixed Income & Senior Credit Fisher these seniors just want something free.  They can be rich or poor it does not matter.  Offer them a free pamphlet with our newest merchandise. \n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Fancy words: Senior fancy words likes to at least 2-3 old time words per conversation. They pride them selves on knowing such words and often enjoy telling you what that means.  Most of the time they give a slight pause to let the word soak in and see if you know what it means.   The best remedy for this is to have Google at hand. If your quick enough you can give a quick response with the meaning of the word. This usually throws Senior Fancy words for a loop and they will quickly end the conversation.\n\n\nSenior Braggart: Unlike other seniors who brag about very specific things, these seniors will brag about almost anything. Killed a stray rat with my walker to bragging about how they found a new way to deal with junk mail, these seniors will be sure to let you know!!!\n\n\n\n\nSenior No credit:  These seniors have spent their entire life using cash and have no built credit. Sadly when it comes time for a credit check they won\u2019t pass.  I always hated telling these seniors that I could not open an account\u2026\n\n\n\n\nSenior Whiz: These seniors first off know just about everything about their service. They know their mobile numbers, rate plans and billing cycle. They even know how to dial AAA using the quick dial. They usually call in to go over things they already know just to impress you on how great of a customer they are.  Chances  are Senior Whiz will remember who they dealt with last\u2026\n\n\nSenior Clarification:  These seniors require clarification on everything you tell them about their plan. They also tend to call in weekly or Bi Weekly for further clarifications on what they are signed up for, monthly cost etc.  These are our bread and butter customers who keep us busy!!!\n\n  \n\n\nSenior Check up: These seniors sort of display behaviors associated with Senior Indirect: and Senior Insecure: However they have no problem dealing directly with you. The main thing that sets these seniors apart from other seniors is they will always call back and ask that rep if the last rep did what they wanted. Most often confirming what the last rep did or said will end the call, however Senior Check Up can very quickly become a Senior Instigator if they feel in a rotten mood.  No advice for you on these seniors except make sure you notate the account and do exactly what you told them you would do for them.        \n\n\n\nSenior Feel Sorry for me: These seniors play the victim and put on a sad act. Their act is to make you think they need to cancel. Most of the time they will manipulate a conversation and try to make you feel like you are the one that  backed them into a corner to quit service. They give pauses hoping you will save them with phone credits or free stuff. These seniors usually call back and speak to another rep to restart service for a few months before repeating the Feel sorry for me cycle.  Really you can't help them as this may happen to 1 in every 50 seniors!!\n\n\n\nSenior Favorite Rep: These seniors feel as though they have built a reputation with a certain rep and thus by only speaking to that rep will in turn receive better service or special breaks ie:  credits, special rates etc.  Nothing short of a miracle will get Senior Favorite Rep to talk with a different rep.  I\u2019ve found it easier just to get them to whom they want to speak with\n\n\nSenior Rude Behavior:  These seniors typically display rude behavior that\u2019s not always directed at the rep. Be it a senior belch or a slow paced tinkle in the potty, these seniors are oblivious that you can hear what\u2019s going on in the background. Most seniors are nice to you but just display behaviors that are best left in private.   Don\u2019t tell them you can hear, they will get embarrassed \n\n\nSenior Ghost Caller: That\u2019s not a prank phone call, its just gramps talking about grandma to his best friend while his cell phone is in his back pocket!!! Seems all them calls he never makes are because he sits on his cell phone. Just note the account for the next rep and hang up\u2026 \n\n\n\n\nSenior Insecure: These seniors require special handling when working with them on their account.  They really don\u2019t want the service but they know that as soon as they drop it they will need it right away. They hang on by the thread and are never sure about what to do. Just take them by the hand and make them feel good about their service\n\nSenior Multiple Speak: These seniors have a million things racing thru their mind (which I suppose keeps them going) but its when they talk that you can quickly become confused. They tend to ask a question followed by another question followed by a statement followed by another question combined with a statement that often has nothing to do with why they called in the first place.   They may be a hassle for you but let them vent it all out than inform them you are not as fast as they are and will need to handle one issue at one time\n\n\n\nSenior New Age: These are people who have just reached the 65 mark and really are in touch with the goings of today\u2019s society. They may display any of the typical senior behaviors but are more confident when doing so (with the exception to senior indirect and other timid senior   behaviors) Just usher these new seniors in and be nice..\n\n\n\n\nSenior Denial:  If these seniors lost 1 year for every time they denied their age they would be about \u201350 years old.   They sometimes flex their voice to sound younger and hate giving their Date of Birth for credit checks and such.  NOTE: If a senior Denial gives the last 4 of the social but not the Date of birth you can be sure it\u2019s a Senior Denial and not a Senior Super Security!!   Just follow the rules for credit checks\u2026\n\n\n\nSenior My Way:  These seniors almost always try to buck the system using their own methods and reasoning. You are always expected to go along with their way of doing things.  Whether its them saying they paid ahead and expecting you to agree and confirm with them what they said is true.  When really they paid current and past due amount. \nJust keep repeating in your head\u2026 I\u2019m not going crazy, I\u2019m not going crazy\n\n\n\n\nSenior They Said: This is not to be confused with Senior Stumper or Senior Quote; these seniors have no qualms about making up a full fledge fib. Always quoting that imaginary person \u2018 they \u201c these seniors will say anything to prove to you that what                \u201c they\u201d told them is correct.  Just tell them that \u201cthey\u201d was wrong\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Drama:  Forget that grandma Lulu lost gramps to a 20-year-old women. Forget that during the senior dance fest grandma was dancing too close to the DJ!! . These seniors love to cause drama with every breath they take.  Typically these seniors are taking care of their grand children because their son or daughter decided it was too hard. These seniors are typically on a fixed income but always manage to get by. They may exhibit behaviors often associated with Senior Low Income or Senior My Way. \nThey will almost always tell you about the grandchildren\u2026\n\n\n\n\nSenior Smoker: Is that Grandpa or Grandma? I can\u2019t tell!!! Who knows because it\u2019s Senior Smoker!!  These seniors are always mellow unless they call before the morning cigarette and cup of coffee. It\u2019s best to get their name first!! Never assume it\u2019s a man or women\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Identifier: These seniors always get the first word in and always start out by identifying themselves. Rep: Thank you for calling consumer.. Senior Identifier: Hello this is John Smith I have an account with you and I am also a AAA member for 30 years. My address is\u2026 My home state is\u2026  Senior Identifier almost always never starts off with the correct information needed ie; Account number or 10-digit cell phone number.  Just allow them to babble and act as though it means something, than politely ask for the 10-digit cell or account number.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Distractions: Whether its the 24-hour Bingo channel blaring in the background or gramps playing with his false teeth   Senior Distractions will always have a distraction for you when calling in.  Just try to ignore the distractions and go about helping them. Senior Distractions can sometimes become angry and feel like you are ignoring them\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Heavy Thought: Forget asking questions, these seniors will ponder for minutes what you tell them. They will use their own logic and reasoning to decipher what you tell them.  After several minutes of thinking Senior Heavy Thought: will finally come up with a course of action or request they want you to consider / do for them.  Just grab a book while you wait...\n\n\n\n\nSenior One Liner:  These seniors (typically males) will always have that one line they want to say before the call ends. Most of the time its an opening or closing line. Sometimes it requires the conversation to be lead to a subject where the senior can pop off his or her one line.  Senior one liner will feel as though their call went sour if they are not allowed to pop off their one line.   Senior One Liners are easy to work with after they have said their one liner\u2026\n\n\n\nSenior call a lot:  These seniors call in a lot just for the sake of feeling busy and or important.  Not really having a good reason to call they often can be spotted checking their minutes or going over their rate plan. They typically call in 2-3 times a or1-2 times daily.. Senior Call a lot is easy to work with most of the time\u2026 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Vocabulary and phrases that will help you understand senior speak. \n\n\nMobile Communication Device:  This is senior techno babble for Cell Phone. \n\nLet me think about this: A senior\u2019s way of saying I don\u2019t get my social security until the 3rd of the month. \n\nI did not make that call: This is a senior\u2019s way of saying \u201cI don\u2019t remember making that call\u201d\n\n\nMy phone is not old, I\u2019ve only had it 5 Years: This is a seniors way of saying \u201c My phone should not warring down until its physically broken\u201d OR  \u201c I hate the thought of having to buy another phone\u201d\n\n\nThese buttons are too small: A Seniors way of saying, \u201cMy eye sight is poor\u201d OR \u201cI have big fingers and can\u2019t dial numbers correctly\u201d\n\n\n\nI did not use the service that month:  In Senior speak this means \u201cI should not have to pay since I did not use the phone\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019m a long time customer: This means \u201cI expect good service and any special discount you haves\u201d   \n\n\nMy phone is broken: This could mean anything from \u201c I don\u2019t know how to turn my phone on and am embarrassed to admit it\u201d OR\u201d I don\u2019t know how to call out but this is my indirect way of asking for help\u201d.\n\n\nI don\u2019t call my self: (when being asked for the 10-digit cell number) This is senior speak for \u201cI can\u2019t remember my cell number because I never use it\u201d\n\n\nThis instruction Book you sent is worthless:  \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about my cell phone and am hinting at needing help with my phone \u201c\n\n\nI\u2019ll get my grandkids to help me with this: In senior speak this means,  \u201c I am still not understanding you and need to see how to do this\u201d OR \u201c I am tired and want to get off the phone\u201d\nI need to return this phone: most commonly this is the senior way of saying \u201c I want to cancel service\u201d \n\n\n\nI need go over my bill: Another senior way of saying \u201c I don\u2019t understand why my bill is this much\u201d OR  \u201c There\u2019s numbers on here I don\u2019t remember calling but I am too embarrassed to admit I can\u2019t remember so I am going to deny I made these calls\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeniors are sure a mixed lot that requires special treatment, when dealing with seniors remember that they over all have a right to be respected and their issue handled. How you handle the issue depends on the senior type. With this senior spotting guide I hope you can spot the different seniors and know ahead of time how to handle them. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "I used to work at a call center that marketed phones to OLD people...
