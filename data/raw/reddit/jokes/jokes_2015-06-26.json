No details are given pending payment.  The man decides to take his chances, pays his fee, and is told to disrobe.  He is escorted to a room adorned like a roman emperor's suite - round bed, mirrored ceilings, heavy drapes, hot tub, sexual toys and enhancements.  In the middle of the room is a nubile young lady, beautiful, and naked except for a sign she holds that says:  \"You catch me, you f*ck me.\"\n\nAn hour later the man leaves, 5 pounds lighter and unquestionably happier with a spring in his step.\n\nSeeing as he is still overweight, he returns to the office the next day and asks for any other weight loss specials he might take advantage of.  The proprietor tells him there is a more \"rigorous\" option available, the results being a loss of 10 lb in one session, but double the price.  Based on his first session, the man concludes this must involve two female companions - or more!\n\nHe again pays his money and is asked to disrobe.  He is led to another door, which opens up into what can only be described as a concrete and steel warehouse.  No bed, no drapes, no opulence.  Waiting him in the middle of the room is a gorilla holding a sign:  \"I catch you, I f*ck you.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "title": "Extreme Weight Loss [NSFW]", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": true, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_3b6sl9", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3b6sl9/extreme_weight_loss_nsfw/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "3b6sl9", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "greyhound93", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3b6sl9/extreme_weight_loss_nsfw/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1435352216.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3b6sl9/extreme_weight_loss_nsfw/", "created_utc": 1435323416.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A slip of the tongue and you&#39;re in for some shit. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "A slip of the tongue and you're in for some shit.
