Jake continues \"I've put in regional accents for each city\". The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. \"That's not all,\" says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very hi-resolution, map of New York City appears on the display. \"The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning,\" explains Jake. \"View recede ten,\" Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state. \"I want to buy this watch!\" says the stranger. \"Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the bugs, says the inventor. \"But look at this,\" and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books,\" though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far\" says Jake.  \"I've got to have this watch!\" says the stranger. \"No, you don't understand; it's not ready.\" \"I'll give you $1000 for it!\"  \"Oh, no, I've already spent more than -\" \"I'll give you $5000 for it!\" \"But it's just not -\" \"I'll give you $15,000 for it!\" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook. Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8500 into materials and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. The stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. \"Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000. Take it or leave it.\" Jake abruptly makes his decision. \"OK,\" he says, and peels off the watch. They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. \"Hey, wait a minute,\" calls Jake after the stranger, who turns around warily. Jake points to the two suitcases he'd been trying to wrestle through the bus station. \"Don't forget your batteries.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text":

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he&#39;d try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn&#39;t much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don&#39;t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. &quot;Except what?&quot; the man asked. &quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot; &quot;C&#39;mon, tell me! I need something!&quot; &quot;Well, sir, I don&#39;t usually mention this, but there is the &#39;voodoo dick.&#39;&quot; &quot;So what&#39;s up with this voodoo dick?&quot; he asked.</p>\n\n<p>The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said &quot;Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!&quot; The old man replied, &quot;But you haven&#39;t seen what it&#39;ll do yet.&quot; He pointed to a door and said &quot;Voodoo dick, the door.&quot; The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said &quot;Voodoo dick, get back in your box!&quot; The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. &quot;I&#39;ll take it!&quot; said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn&#39;t for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say &quot;Voodoo dick, my pussy.&quot; He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.</p>\n\n<p>After he&#39;d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said &quot;Voodoo dick, my pussy!&quot; The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she&#39;d ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she&#39;d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.

Voodoo dick, my ass!&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "\nThere was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, \"Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. \"Except what?\" the man asked. \"Nothing, nothing.\" \"C'mon, tell me! I need something!\" \"Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'\" \"So what's up with this voodoo dick?\" he asked.\n\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said \"Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\" The old man replied, \"But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.\" He pointed to a door and said \"Voodoo dick, the door.\" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said \"Voodoo dick, get back in your box!\" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. \"I'll take it!\" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say \"Voodoo dick, my pussy.\" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.\n\nAfter he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said \"Voodoo dick, my pussy!\" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.
