Suddenly, from the rear of the plane, an elderly man in the uniform of an Air Force General is seen slowly walking forward up the aisle. Stopping the flustered mother with an upraised hand, the white-haired, courtly, soft-spoken General leans down and, motioning toward his chest, whispers something into the boy's ear. \n\nInstantly, the boy calms down, gently takes his mother's hand, and quietly fastens his seat belt. \n\nAll the other passengers burst into spontaneous applause. As the General slowly makes his way back to his seat, one of the cabin attendants touches his sleeve. \n\n\"Excuse me, General,\" she asks quietly, \"but could I ask you what magic words you used on that little boy?\" \n\nThe old man smiles serenely and gently confides, \"I showed him my pilot's wings, service stars, and battle ribbons, and explained that they entitle me to throw one passenger out the plane door, on any flight I choose.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Pilot Choice", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1jnql2", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jnql2/pilot_choice/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1jnql2", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jersey66077", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 197, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jnql2/pilot_choice/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1375611201.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jnql2/pilot_choice/", "created_utc": 1375582401.0, "ups": 197, "num_comments": 6}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>He&#39;s all right now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "He's all right now.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Did you hear about the guy that lost the whole left side of his body?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1jnpg5", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jnpg5/did_you_hear_about_the_guy_that_lost_the_whole/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1jnpg5", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "schmoker1", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jnpg5/did_you_hear_about_the_guy_that_lost_the_whole/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1375610038.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1jnpg5/did_you_hear_about_the_guy_that_lost_the_whole/", "created_utc": 1375581238.0, "ups": 2, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>In most places, losing your khakis means you have no pants.
