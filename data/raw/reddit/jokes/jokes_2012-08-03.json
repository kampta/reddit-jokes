She comes back downstairs slowly, takes a big breath and asks Johnny 'and what would YOU like for breakfast Johnny?' Johnny is sitting there, pale and absolutely petrified. He thinks for a few seconds and says 'I dunno but you can bet your fucking arse it won't be Coco Pops'.\n\nLittle Johnny is playing with his trains in the living room, while his mother is nearby in the kitchen. This is what she hears. \"Alright you sons of bitches and dirty whores, the train is leaving from platform 1 in five fucking minutes, so if you're not ready, you're fucked'. She runs in screaming at him not to talk like that, and sends him up to his room for two hours. Two hours later Johnny walks back downstairs, subdued, and starts playing with his trains again. From the kitchen, this is what she hears. 'Ladies and gentlemen, the train will be departing from platform one in five minutes. Please ensure you have your luggage ready and that you board the train in an orderly fashion. If anyone has a problem with the two hour delay, take it up with the fucking bitch in the kitchen'.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A couple of Little Johnny jokes.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_xm2vg", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/xm2vg/a_couple_of_little_johnny_jokes/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "xm2vg", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hypopyon", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 438, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/xm2vg/a_couple_of_little_johnny_jokes/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1344013863.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/xm2vg/a_couple_of_little_johnny_jokes/", "created_utc": 1343985063.0, "ups": 438, "num_comments": 28}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Because he left a shrimp cock-trail.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Because he left a shrimp cock-trail.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "How can you tell that a shrimp with a big dick was walking down the beach?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_xmlg6", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/xmlg6/how_can_you_tell_that_a_shrimp_with_a_big_dick/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "xmlg6", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thaddeus_T_Third_III", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 47, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/xmlg6/how_can_you_tell_that_a_shrimp_with_a_big_dick/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1344041866.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/xmlg6/how_can_you_tell_that_a_shrimp_with_a_big_dick/", "created_utc": 1344013066.0, "ups": 47, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A black man is driving along the dusty road of an indian reservation.
