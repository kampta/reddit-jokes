He frantically searches around the apartment for any sign of another man. He looks out on the balcony and notices a pair of hands gripped to the ledge. \n\nSo he finds and grabs his hammer, goes to the balcony, and smashes the fuck out of the hands. The man who was grabbing the ledge falls 10 floors but he lands in some bushes that break his fall. \n\nInfuriated that he lived, James picks up the mini-fridge from the bedroom and throws it on the fucker in the bushes.
