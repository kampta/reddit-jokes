He did let him know however that there will be consequences if he messes up delivering this unfortunate news to Jack. As always, Dan confidently reassures the General that he will take care of it.</p>\n\n<p>The very next day, very early in the morning, all the privates were called to the field.

Private John's wife had passed away in a horrible car accident. \n\nThe General strongly suggested that breaking the news lightly to John would be course of action. \nLieutenant Dan, with his ruthless rude attitude forged by strict old school army rules, confidently assures the General that everything will be done by the book.\n\nThe following day, at 6.00 AM,  all the privates line up.\n\n-Dan: \"- Private John, step forward!\"\n\n-\t*silence*\n\n-Dan: \"- Your wife is dead!\"\n\n\nJohn took the news very badly, he was very upset for months to come, practically becoming useless, and eventually leaving the army. \n\nThe General was very upset for the way the news was handled, so he phones Dan.\n\n-General: \"That was is no way to deliver bad news Lieutenant! You have a chance to reclaim yourself. Unfortunately, Private William Glen's mother has passed away. Please let him know, but be more careful how you deliver the news this time, we don't want any more issues! \"\n\n-Dan: \"Will do General!\"\n\nThe next day all privates are lining up again. Lieutenant Dan looks angry and worried, as if to deliver more bad news.\n\n-Dan: \"- Privates! Everyone whose mother is still alive step forward!\"\n\n-Dan: \"- Private Will, you can stand\"\n\nThe private was also devastated. The news reached headquarters again, and the response from the General was not pleasing. \n\nUnfortunately there's been another incident involving private Jacks mother, who was brutally murdered, so scolding Lieutenant Dan would have to be postponed. He did let him know however that there will be consequences if he messes up delivering this unfortunate news to Jack. As always, Dan confidently reassures the General that he will take care of it.\n\nThe very next day, very early in the morning, all the privates were called to the field. The privates were instantly concerned, suspecting more bad news.\n\n-Dan: \"- Privates! Today we dig trenches!\"\n\nEveryone quickly starts working hard, digging, with a sense of relief for the lack of bad news.\n\n-Dan: \"- Dig, Jack, dig! Maybe you'll find your mom!\"\n\nJack was shocked and mortified at the realization of his mothers death.
