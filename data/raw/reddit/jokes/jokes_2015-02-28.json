laid-off and looking for work, was walking downtown when he happened upon an odd-looking, small office building with the title displayed out front: DR. CALVIN JONES- OPTICAL EXAMINATIONS. He was intrigued and examined the tinted windows near the door. &quot;WE&#39;RE HIRING&quot;, one said. Excited by the prospect of a job, he opened the door and went inside.</p>\n\n<p>There wasn&#39;t much to see. As far as he could tell, it was just an empty lobby, without even a receptionist to greet him. Assuming they were closed and simply forgot to lock up, he was about to walk out when he heard a voice through an intercom near the door.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hey! Is somebody there!?&quot; The voice shouted angrily.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Err...yes, I was wondering if you had any job openings available....where are you? Is this place closed or something? I can&#39;t see anybody here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course you can&#39;t! Get out right this minute!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What?! I was just wondering if you were hiring, is all!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And <em>why</em> would you think that?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I saw the sign out front....&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The voice paused for a moment. &quot;Alright, then. Go down the hallway to your right and up the stairs. You&#39;re hired.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But...!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man was about to protest that he hadn&#39;t even been interviewed, but the intercom cut out and he heard nothing but static, so he did as the voice said and proceeded down the hallway and up to the second floor of the building. It was very cramped, and had little rooms along the corridors, the kind you might see in a doctor&#39;s office. But it wasn&#39;t lit up like the lobby; the lights appeared to be turned off and he couldn&#39;t see a foot in front of him.</p>\n\n<p>He grappled for a light switch and flicked it. At once the hallway was bright, and now he could see another man with a cane and dark glasses closing the door of one of the rooms, saying the words &quot;I don&#39;t see anything wrong.&quot; To a client, the man presumed. Then the second man turned around and began walking towards him, painfully slowly, while the second man made a note that he had a nametag embroidered on his coat, reading <em>Dr. Jones</em>. He must run this place, thought the man. Though he wanted to consult him about the job, the doctor looked busy, so he decided to waste some time looking at a painting of an iris flower on the wall.</p>\n\n<p>Unexpectedly, they collided when the doctor hit the man with his cane.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ow! What the fuck was that for?!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The doctor was equally surprised. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to hit you! I didn&#39;t realise...I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well watch where you&#39;re going next time, okay? My fucking shin hurts now, and all I wanted was a job...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No need to explain yourself, because you&#39;ll be leaving this building shortly. If you didn&#39;t know, you aren&#39;t supposed to be up here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But the intercom told me to come here...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah. One of my interns, up to their old tricks again.

CALVIN JONES- OPTICAL EXAMINATIONS. He was intrigued and examined the tinted windows near the door. \"WE'RE HIRING\", one said. Excited by the prospect of a job, he opened the door and went inside.\n\nThere wasn't much to see. As far as he could tell, it was just an empty lobby, without even a receptionist to greet him. Assuming they were closed and simply forgot to lock up, he was about to walk out when he heard a voice through an intercom near the door.\n\n\"Hey! Is somebody there!?\" The voice shouted angrily.\n\n\"Err...yes, I was wondering if you had any job openings available....where are you? Is this place closed or something? I can't see anybody here.\"\n\n\"Of course you can't! Get out right this minute!\"\n\n\"What?! I was just wondering if you were hiring, is all!\"\n\n\"And *why* would you think that?\"\n\n\"I saw the sign out front....\"\n\nThe voice paused for a moment. \"Alright, then. Go down the hallway to your right and up the stairs. You're hired.\"\n\n\"But...!\"\n\nThe man was about to protest that he hadn't even been interviewed, but the intercom cut out and he heard nothing but static, so he did as the voice said and proceeded down the hallway and up to the second floor of the building. It was very cramped, and had little rooms along the corridors, the kind you might see in a doctor's office. But it wasn't lit up like the lobby; the lights appeared to be turned off and he couldn't see a foot in front of him.\n\nHe grappled for a light switch and flicked it. At once the hallway was bright, and now he could see another man with a cane and dark glasses closing the door of one of the rooms, saying the words \"I don't see anything wrong.\" To a client, the man presumed. Then the second man turned around and began walking towards him, painfully slowly, while the second man made a note that he had a nametag embroidered on his coat, reading *Dr. Jones*. He must run this place, thought the man. Though he wanted to consult him about the job, the doctor looked busy, so he decided to waste some time looking at a painting of an iris flower on the wall.\n\nUnexpectedly, they collided when the doctor hit the man with his cane.\n\n\"Ow! What the fuck was that for?!\"\n\nThe doctor was equally surprised. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit you! I didn't realise...I'm so sorry!\"\n\n\"Well watch where you're going next time, okay? My fucking shin hurts now, and all I wanted was a job...\"\n\n\"No need to explain yourself, because you'll be leaving this building shortly. If you didn't know, you aren't supposed to be up here.\"\n\n\"But the intercom told me to come here...\"\n\n\"Ah. One of my interns, up to their old tricks again. Well, I'm terribly sorry, but you're going to have to leave anyway.\"\n\n\"But they hired me!\"\n\nThe doctor was silent for a moment. \"Hired you? Why would they do that?\"\n\n\"I don't know!
