And english is my second language, please forgive any mistakes.\n\n--\n\nTwo guys are walking through a jungle. They were both part of an expedition of scientists trying to study wildlife there, but their camp got attacked by natives some nights ago. They barely escaped and have since been walking through the jungle, completely lost.\n\nWater is not a problem because it's constantly raining, but they are getting very hungry because they are quite afraid to eat any plant or fruit, being scared it could be poisonous.\n\nSo, while walking through the thick jungle they suddenly stumble upon a dead body. One of their colleagues as it turns out. He was obviously part of a sacrifice by the natives, head, arms and legs are severed from the body, laying several feet away, the rest of the body is pretty badly cut.\n\nAnd through a horrifying, huge slash across his belly they can see his stomach, with a big chunk of half-digested pasta inside, the pasta they had the night before their camp was attacked.\n\nSo they are contemplating what to do. Guy1 really thinks hard and then after a while says \"Nope, can't do it, that's really disgusting.\" Guy2 also thinks hard and after a while decides \"Crap, this is disgusting, but I am nearly starving, I have to eat *something*\".\n\nSo he kneels infront of the dead guy, rips the stomach open with shaky fingers and starts eating the half-digested pasta, out of the stomach of the dead guy.\n\nAfter eating half the pasta he stands up, horrible expression on his face, feeling really bad.\n\nThey start walking again, none of them says a word.\n\nAfter a while Guy2 slowly turns green, shaken by horrible spasms because of the bad food and after a few more minutes he breaks down and starts vomiting out the pasta violently.\n\nTo his surprise Guy1 rushes to him and starts eating the pasta he just vomited, full hands, greedy.\n\n\"Oh my god\", says Guy2, shaken by still vomiting out pasta, \"that's disgusting, why are you eating this now and refused to eat it earlier?\"\n\n\"Well\", says Guy1, \"atleast now they're warm!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false,
