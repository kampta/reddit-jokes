One day for his sixth birthday his parents decided to take him to the circus. Little Sam was so excited he could not stop bouncing in his seat in the car, nor could he stand still in line whilst his parents purchased their tickets.</p>\n\n<p>Sam and his parents find their seats and wait for the circus to commence(the waiting nearly killed Sam). Finally the circus starts; the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, and finally towards the end of the show the clowns come out. This is what Sam has been waiting for all night (he loves to laugh).</p>\n\n<p>The clowns go through their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, etc.. All of the clowns but one leave the center ring. This clown turns on a microphone he is given by the ring master and says, &quot;Ladies and Gentleman! For your last laugh of the evening I will need a volunteer!&quot; Little Sam, not knowing what this was all about, was the only one who did not raise his hand.</p>\n\n<p>The Clown makes a spectacle of choosing his volunteer, and finally the spot light lands on little Sam. He looks to his parents questioningly and they wave him down. After he makes his way down the aisle and into the center ring. The clown asks, &quot;What is your name little boy?&quot; &quot;S-sam.&quot; he replies.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well S-sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?&quot;\n&quot;N-no?&quot;\n&quot;Well little Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?&quot;\n&quot;No.&quot;\n&quot;Well you must be NO end of a jack-ass!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The crowd goes wild with laughter, rofl barely covers it.  All the while this is happening little Sam is mortified to be laughed at by so many people and starts crying right there in the center ring which, much to his dismay, made everyone laugh all the harder. He makes his way back to his parents and they take him home all the way attempting to make him feel better.</p>\n\n<p>---~10 Years Later---</p>\n\n<p>Little Sam is no longer so little, he is now a Sophmore in high-school. Albeit a little awkward, tonight he is taking out a girl for their very first date. Now this girl not only is completely out of his league, but she is a very popular girl. He has done his research and found out that she is dying to go see the circus.</p>\n\n<p>On their way to the circus he is so excited he is almost bouncing in his seat, of course he doesn&#39;t because that would be completely uncool of him. As they are standing in line to get their tickets, he can hardly stand still, he is definitely hoping to get some hand holding action tonight!</p>\n\n<p>They take their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills not so little Sam as he inches his hand ever closer to hers without making it obvious). Finally he touches his pinky finger to her pinky just as the lights go down and the circus starts, which also happens to be when everyone begins to applaud.</p>\n\n<p>He cannot truly enjoy circus because the entire time he is still trying to touch her hand. He can tell by her reactions the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget being shot out of a cannon was exhilarating. Finally the clowns come out.</p>\n\n<p>This is when Sam finally begins to pay attention, he is searching for a clown he has seen 10 years ago that scarred him.</p>\n\n<p><em>NO SHIT!</em> - he thinks to himself - <em>THAT CAN&#39;T BE THE SAME CLOWN!</em> (It was)</p>\n\n<p>The clowns do their usual routine, pies to the face, falling down on purpose, hitting other clowns over the head. Towards the end of the act all of the clown leave the center ring except one. <em>The same fucking clown, god damn-it!</em>  </p>\n\n<p>The clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy for the evening I will need a volunteer!&quot;</p>\n\n<p><em>Like hell I&#39;m going to volunteer</em> Sam thinks to himself, yet in doing this he is the only person not raising his hand. The clown again makes a spectacle of choosing volunteer. Finally the spotlight stops on non so little Sam. </p>\n\n<p>Wide-eyed Sam looks over to his date and she has a brilliant smile on her face and urges him to go down after a quick kiss on the cheek. After this moment Sam is in a daze <em>my first kiss, oh my god, it was amazing</em>.  The next thing he knows he is standing before the clown in the center ring.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is your name young man?&quot;\n<em>I hope its not the same lame ass joke</em> &quot;My name is Sam.&quot;\n&quot;Well Sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?&quot;\n<em>Really? Again?</em> Reluctantly Sam says, &quot;No.&quot;\n&quot;Well Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?&quot;\n&quot;Ugh No.&quot;\n&quot;Well then Sam, you must be <strong>NO</strong> end of a jack-ass!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The crowd completely goes wild, rotflmfao barely covers it.  He looks into the seats where he and his date were sitting and she is laughing just as hard as everyone else. For some reason that Sam cannot explain to this very day he broke down crying, this time in front of everyone and his date, which makes the crowd laugh even harder.</p>\n\n<p>This day Sam swears his revenge on this god-awful clown.</p>\n\n<p>---~10 Years Later---</p>\n\n<p>Big Sam is now 26 years old with a family of his own; a wife of 5 years, two beautiful children, a dog, all that good shit. </p>\n\n<p>For vacation Sam decides to take his family on a cruise ship. Big Sam is bouncing in his seat (he doesn&#39;t have to be cool anymore), his children are as well. As wait to board the ship Sam can hardly stand still <em>Open Bar! Free Child Care! Free Massage!</em>. As he is handed a list of events from the person overseeing the boarding he notices there is even a circus on this cruise. <em>No way, what would the odds be?</em></p>\n\n<p>They enjoy their cruise, and on the last night Sam brings his family to the circus. They get their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills his children). The lights finally go down and it begins. The trapeze were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget getting shot out of a cannon was riveting, the motorcycles that go around in a sphere nearly took their breath away, finally the clowns come out.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ok you mother fucking clown where are you at? Where, oh where can you--AHA!</em> Sam spots the clown that has caused him so much pain in the past which is great for him because he has come up with the perfect response to this clown. </p>\n\n<p>The clowns do their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, hitting others over the head with hammers, spraying others with water jet flowers. Towards the end of the act all of the clowns except one leave the center ring. </p>\n\n<p><em>Show time!</em></p>\n\n<p>The clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy tonight I will need a volunteer!&quot;</p>\n\n<p><em>If I don&#39;t raise my hand you&#39;re going to pick me. I know your game clown!</em></p>\n\n<p>As usual big Sam is the only one that does not raise his hand. The clown makes a big spectacle of choosing his volunteer. Finally the spotlight lands on big Sam.</p>\n\n<p><em>Now its my turn!</em></p>\n\n<p>Before he knows it Sam is down in front of the clown with a smug smile on his face.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well sir, what would your name be?&quot;\n&quot;My name would be Sam&quot;, he replies with a confidence that makes the clown a little uneasy.\n&quot;Well Sam, are you the front-end of a jack-ass?&quot;\n&quot;No, not I am not the front-end of a jack-ass.&quot;, he answers as smugly as he can manage. He is now bubbling with anticipation.\n&quot;Yes, well then, are you the back-end of a jack-ass?&quot;\n&quot;Ha no, no I am not.&quot;\n&quot;Well Sam, You must be <strong>NO</strong> end of a jack-ass!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The crowd goes wild, little old ladies have heart attacks, ICU hardly covers it.</p>\n\n<p>Sam grabs the microphone from the clown, and the crowd immediately quiets down.</p>\n\n<p>Sam looks the clown straight in the face and says, &quot;Fuck you.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "As a child Sam was as happy as could be; playing with sticks, climbing trees, all that good shit.

This is what Sam has been waiting for all night (he loves to laugh).\n\nThe clowns go through their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, etc.. All of the clowns but one leave the center ring. This clown turns on a microphone he is given by the ring master and says, \"Ladies and Gentleman! For your last laugh of the evening I will need a volunteer!\" Little Sam, not knowing what this was all about, was the only one who did not raise his hand.\n\nThe Clown makes a spectacle of choosing his volunteer, and finally the spot light lands on little Sam. He looks to his parents questioningly and they wave him down. After he makes his way down the aisle and into the center ring. The clown asks, \"What is your name little boy?\" \"S-sam.\" he replies.\n\n\"Well S-sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?\"\n\"N-no?\"\n\"Well little Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Well you must be NO end of a jack-ass!\"\n\nThe crowd goes wild with laughter, rofl barely covers it.  All the while this is happening little Sam is mortified to be laughed at by so many people and starts crying right there in the center ring which, much to his dismay, made everyone laugh all the harder. He makes his way back to his parents and they take him home all the way attempting to make him feel better.\n\n---~10 Years Later---\n\nLittle Sam is no longer so little, he is now a Sophmore in high-school. Albeit a little awkward, tonight he is taking out a girl for their very first date. Now this girl not only is completely out of his league, but she is a very popular girl. He has done his research and found out that she is dying to go see the circus.\n\nOn their way to the circus he is so excited he is almost bouncing in his seat, of course he doesn't because that would be completely uncool of him. As they are standing in line to get their tickets, he can hardly stand still, he is definitely hoping to get some hand holding action tonight!\n\nThey take their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills not so little Sam as he inches his hand ever closer to hers without making it obvious). Finally he touches his pinky finger to her pinky just as the lights go down and the circus starts, which also happens to be when everyone begins to applaud.\n\nHe cannot truly enjoy circus because the entire time he is still trying to touch her hand. He can tell by her reactions the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget being shot out of a cannon was exhilarating. Finally the clowns come out.\n\nThis is when Sam finally begins to pay attention, he is searching for a clown he has seen 10 years ago that scarred him.\n\n*NO SHIT!* - he thinks to himself - *THAT CAN'T BE THE SAME CLOWN!* (It was)\n\nThe clowns do their usual routine, pies to the face, falling down on purpose, hitting other clowns over the head. Towards the end of the act all of the clown leave the center ring except one. *The same fucking clown, god damn-it!*  \n\nThe clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy for the evening I will need a volunteer!\"\n\n*Like hell I'm going to volunteer* Sam thinks to himself, yet in doing this he is the only person not raising his hand. The clown again makes a spectacle of choosing volunteer. Finally the spotlight stops on non so little Sam. \n\nWide-eyed Sam looks over to his date and she has a brilliant smile on her face and urges him to go down after a quick kiss on the cheek. After this moment Sam is in a daze *my first kiss, oh my god, it was amazing*.  The next thing he knows he is standing before the clown in the center ring.\n\n\"What is your name young man?\"\n*I hope its not the same lame ass joke* \"My name is Sam.\"\n\"Well Sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?\"\n*Really? Again?* Reluctantly Sam says, \"No.\"\n\"Well Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?\"\n\"Ugh No.\"\n\"Well then Sam, you must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!\"\n\nThe crowd completely goes wild, rotflmfao barely covers it.  He looks into the seats where he and his date were sitting and she is laughing just as hard as everyone else. For some reason that Sam cannot explain to this very day he broke down crying, this time in front of everyone and his date, which makes the crowd laugh even harder.\n\nThis day Sam swears his revenge on this god-awful clown.\n\n---~10 Years Later---\n\nBig Sam is now 26 years old with a family of his own; a wife of 5 years, two beautiful children, a dog, all that good shit. \n\nFor vacation Sam decides to take his family on a cruise ship. Big Sam is bouncing in his seat (he doesn't have to be cool anymore), his children are as well. As wait to board the ship Sam can hardly stand still *Open Bar! Free Child Care! Free Massage!*. As he is handed a list of events from the person overseeing the boarding he notices there is even a circus on this cruise. *No way, what would the odds be?*\n\nThey enjoy their cruise, and on the last night Sam brings his family to the circus. They get their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills his children). The lights finally go down and it begins. The trapeze were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget getting shot out of a cannon was riveting, the motorcycles that go around in a sphere nearly took their breath away, finally the clowns come out.\n\n*Ok you mother fucking clown where are you at? Where, oh where can you--AHA!* Sam spots the clown that has caused him so much pain in the past which is great for him because he has come up with the perfect response to this clown. \n\nThe clowns do their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, hitting others over the head with hammers, spraying others with water jet flowers. Towards the end of the act all of the clowns except one leave the center ring. \n\n*Show time!*\n\nThe clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy tonight I will need a volunteer!\"\n\n*If I don't raise my hand you're going to pick me. I know your game clown!*\n\nAs usual big Sam is the only one that does not raise his hand. The clown makes a big spectacle of choosing his volunteer. Finally the spotlight lands on big Sam.\n\n*Now its my turn!*\n\nBefore he knows it Sam is down in front of the clown with a smug smile on his face.\n\n\"Well sir, what would your name be?\"\n\"My name would be Sam\", he replies with a confidence that makes the clown a little uneasy.\n\"Well Sam, are you the front-end of a jack-ass?\"\n\"No, not I am not the front-end of a jack-ass.\", he answers as smugly as he can manage. He is now bubbling with anticipation.\n\"Yes, well then, are you the back-end of a jack-ass?\"\n\"Ha no, no I am not.\"\n\"Well Sam, You must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!\"\n\nThe crowd goes wild, little old ladies have heart attacks, ICU hardly covers it.\n\nSam grabs the microphone from the clown, and the crowd immediately quiets down.\n\nSam looks the clown straight in the face and says, \"Fuck you.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A man and a clown (long but worth it(anti-joke joke))", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_14xey5", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/14xey5/a_man_and_a_clown_long_but_worth_itantijoke_joke/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "14xey5", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SkaiiNyght", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/14xey5/a_man_and_a_clown_long_but_worth_itantijoke_joke/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1355661012.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/14xey5/a_man_and_a_clown_long_but_worth_itantijoke_joke/", "created_utc": 1355632212.0, "ups": 15, "num_comments": 5}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>You may not know this but Michael J Fox still has a very fruitful career in Hollywood, though now a days he&#39;s behind the camera.

When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.</p>\n\n<p>At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup&#39;s bottom edge.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;All this was just too wonderful for words,&quot; he said, &quot;but what&#39;s the dollar for?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you.&quot; He said, &quot;Screw him, give him a dollar.&quot; The lady then said, &quot;The breakfast was my idea.&quot;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A lady goes to her parish priest one day and tells him, &quot;Father, I have a problem. I have two female parrots but they only know how to say one thing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do they say?&quot; the priest inquired.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They say, &#39;Hi, we&#39;re prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?&#39;&quot; the woman said embarrassingly.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s obscene!&quot; the priest exclaimed, &quot;I can see why you are embarrassed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He thought a minute and then said, &quot;You know, I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship. I&#39;m sure your parrots will stop saying that...that phrase in no time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; the lady responded, &quot;this may very well be the solution.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest&#39;s house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.</p>\n\n<p>After just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out in unison, &quot;Hi, we&#39;re prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There was a stunned silence. Finally, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and said, &quot;Put the beads away, Francis, our prayers have been answered!&quot;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.</p>\n\n<p>He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. &quot;Goodness,&quot; says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.</p>\n\n<p>Upon awaking, the little guy says, &quot;Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man says, &quot;I can&#39;t take anything from you, I&quot;m just glad I didn&quot;t hurt you too badly,&quot; and walks away.</p>\n\n<p>Watching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, &quot;Well, he was a nice enough guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I&#39;ll give him the three things that I would want. I&#39;ll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Well, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.</p>\n\n<p>The leprechaun says, &quot;I&#39;m fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The golfer says, &quot;It&#39;s great! I hit under par every time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The leprechaun says, &quot;I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The golfer says, &quot;Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The leprechaun smiles and says, &quot;I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, &quot;Well, maybe once or twice a week.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The leprechaun is floored and stammers, &quot;Once or twice a week?!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, &quot;Well, that&#39;s not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.&quot;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Two lawyers walking through the woods spotted a vicious looking bear.</p>\n\n<p>The first lawyer immediately opened his briefcase, pulled out a pair of sneakers and started putting them on.</p>\n\n<p>The second lawyer looked at him and said, &quot;You&#39;re crazy!

The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled.</p>\n\n<p>Officer #2: Thank you sir, one of my officers told me you didn&#39;t have a licence, stole this car, raped and murdered the owner.</p>\n\n<p>Man: I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>An exhausted hunter out in the woods stumbled across another hunter.</p>\n\n<p>Hunter #1: &quot;Am I glad to see you, I&#39;ve been lost for three days.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hunter #2: &quot;Don&#39;t get too excited, friend, I&#39;ve been lost for three weeks.&quot;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>After a 2 year study, the National Science Foundation announced the following results on America&#39;s ball-related recreational preferences:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The sport of choice for unemployed or incarcerated people is basketball.</p></li>\n<li><p>The sport of choice for maintenance level employees is bowling.</p></li>\n<li><p>The sport of choice for blue-collar workers is football.</p></li>\n<li><p>The sport of choice for supervisors is baseball.</p></li>\n<li><p>The sport of choice for middle management is tennis.</p></li>\n<li><p>The sport of choice for corporate officers is golf.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Conclusion: The higher you rise in the corporate structure, the smaller your balls become.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>An old guy in his Volvo is driving home from work when his wife rings him on his carphone. &quot;Honey&quot;, she says in a worried voice, &quot;be careful.

But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But how?&quot; inquired the lawyer. &quot;You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.&quot;\nAnswered the jury foreman: &quot;Oh, we did look.

Pointing across the parking lot she gestured toward the local bank while handing him stock certificates worth nearly $2 million dollars and informing him that he was the largest stockholder in the bank. She told him that for 30 years she had charged him each time they had sex , and this was the result of her investments.</p>\n\n<p>By now he was distraught and beating his head against the side of the car.

When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.\n\n\nAt the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.\n\n\n\"All this was just too wonderful for words,\" he said, \"but what's the dollar for?\" \"Well,\" she said, \"last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you.

Do you want to have some fun?'\" the woman said embarrassingly.\n\n\n\"That's obscene!\" the priest exclaimed, \"I can see why you are embarrassed.\"\n\n\nHe thought a minute and then said, \"You know, I may have a solution to this problem. I have two male parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop saying that...that phrase in no time.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" the lady responded, \"this may very well be the solution.\"\n\n\nThe next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding their rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.\n\n\nAfter just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out in unison, \"Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?\"\n\n\nThere was a stunned silence. Finally, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and said, \"Put the beads away, Francis, our prayers have been answered!\"\n\n---\n\nOne fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.\n\n\nHe goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. \"Goodness,\" says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.\n\n\nUpon awaking, the little guy says, \"Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.\"\n\n\nThe man says, \"I can't take anything from you, I\"m just glad I didn\"t hurt you too badly,\" and walks away.\n\n\nWatching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, \"Well, he was a nice enough guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I'll give him the three things that I would want. I'll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.\"\n\n\nWell, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.\n\n\nThe leprechaun says, \"I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?\"\n\n\nThe golfer says, \"It's great! I hit under par every time.\"\n\n\nThe leprechaun says, \"I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?\"\n\n\nThe golfer says, \"Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.\"\n\n\nThe leprechaun smiles and says, \"I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?\"\n\n\nThe golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, \"Well, maybe once or twice a week.\"\n\n\nThe leprechaun is floored and stammers, \"Once or twice a week?!\"\n\n\nThe golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, \"Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.\"\n\n---\n\nTwo lawyers walking through the woods spotted a vicious looking bear.\n\n\nThe first lawyer immediately opened his briefcase, pulled out a pair of sneakers and started putting them on.\n\n\nThe second lawyer looked at him and said, \"You're crazy!

The needle hit 90, 100, 130 and finally 150 with the light still behind him. \"What the hell am I doing?\" he thought and pulled over.\n\n\nThe cop came up to him, took his license without a word and examined it and the car. \"I've had a tough shift and this is my last pull over.

Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones.\n\n\nUnable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward and tucked everything back into place.\nOn regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by.\n\n\nThe mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.\n\n---\n\nA golfer stands over his tee shot for what seems an eternity to his partner. He looks up, looks down, measures the distance and figures the wind direction and speed. The longer he takes, the more his partner fidgets. Finally his exasperated partner says, \"What's taking so long? Hit the blasted ball.\"\nThe guy answers, \"My wife is up there watching me from the clubhouse. I want to make this a perfect shot.\"\n\n\n\"Forget it, man,\" the partner says. \"You'll never hit her from here.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Mafia was looking for a new man to make weekly collections from all the private businesses that they were \"protecting.\" Feeling the heat from the police force, they decide to use a deaf and dumb person for this job. If he were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police what he was doing.\n\n\nOn his first week, the collector picks up over $40,000. He gets greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place. The Mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.\n\n\nThe hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. The deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the Mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.\n\n\nThe Mafia hood says to the interpreter, \"Ask him where da money is.\"\n\n\nThe interpreter signs, \"Where's the money?\"\n\n\nThe dumb man signs back, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\nThe interpreter tells the hood, \"He says he doesn't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\nThe hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the dumb collector. \"Now ask him where the money is!\"\n\n\nThe interpreter signs, \"Where is the money?\n\n\nThe deaf man signs back, \"The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park.\"\n\n\nThe interpreter says to the hood, \"He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger.\"\n\n---\n\nSo, Donald Rumsfeld is briefing George Bush in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\"Oh and finally, sir, three Brazilian soldiers were killed in Iraq today.\"\n\n\nBush goes pale, his jaw hanging open in stunned disbelief. He buries his\nface in his hands, muttering \"My God...My God\".\n\n\n\"Mr. President,\" says Cheney, \"we lose soldiers all the time, and it's\nterrible. But I've never seen you so upset. What's the matter?\"\n\n\nBush looks up and says...\"How many is a Brazilian?\"\n\n---\n\nA trucker who has been out on the road for two weeks stops at a brothel outside Atlanta. He walks straight up to the Madam, drops down $500 and says, \"I want your ugliest woman and a grilled cheese sandwich!\"\n\n\nThe Madam is astonished. \"But sir, for that kind of money you could have one of my finest ladies and a three-course meal.\"\n\n\nThe trucker replies, \"Listen Darlin, I ain't horny. I'm homesick.\"\n\n---\n\nA woman walks into a restaurant and sits down. As she bends down to reach into her purse for her wallet, she farts loudly with the waiter right behind her. She sits abruptly back up, glares at the waiter and shouts \u201cStop that!\u201d\n\n\nTo which the waiter replies, \u201cSure, which way did it go?\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A collection of jokes I had saved on my PC.
