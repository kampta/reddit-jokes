Celebrating his tail off.</p>\n\n<p>See, he&#39;d spent the last 25 years cataloging every single dance performed by every group in the world. Polish Bogarodzicas. Sioux Buckskin dances to Seminole Green Corn dances. Inuit dances to the whales, Ghanaian Kpanlongo, Finnish step-dance. All of it. And he&#39;s found himself in Australia, recording the last one of all. A Wungubal in the north, performed by a small group of Aborigines. He taped it. He wrote it down. He was finally finished.</p>\n\n<p>He&#39;s had a few beers to celebrate this, and the bartender asks what he&#39;s celebrating. The professor tells him, and also decides to buy the bar a round.</p>\n\n<p>A quiet man in a black suit and a bowler hat comes up to the bar, puts his hand on the anthropologist&#39;s shoulder, and whispers into his ear...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You seen the <em>Butcher</em> dance yet, mate?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The professor admits he hasn&#39;t. But since he&#39;s seen every dance, he&#39;s sure he&#39;s taped it somewhere. The gentleman in the hat says, &quot;Noooooo, my friend. If you&#39;ve seen it, you would remember it. It&#39;s only performed by this one tribe. Deep, deep, deep in the bush. Done by the Barrabarra tribe.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;But the Barrabarra have been extinct for half a century!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No, mate. There&#39;s 30 of them left. And they&#39;re the last ones to do the Butcher dance.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The professor puts down his beer, runs to the car to get his film crew, and they ask the man for directions. He just NEEDS to see the Butcher dance. The directions are long and winding, and they tend to go on geological features instead of any compass readings. Pages and pages of directions.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Pass a stone shaped like a dead woman&#39;s hand. Climb into the valley cut by the knife of the gods. Walk 20 miles by the light of the brightest star...&quot; etc.</p>\n\n<p>They begin their trek. Days pass.</p>\n\n<p>The better part of their sound equipment falls and shatters while they&#39;re climbing a gorge. After two weeks, he loses his first cameraman. Taipan bit him, and they were too far out to get any antidote. This utter tragedy only inflames the professor&#39;s desire, the price he must pay to see the mysterious Butcher dance. Their nights are freezing, their days are burned by the sun. And they finally come upon a fire within a circle of walled stone, surrounded by 30 shadowy figures.</p>\n\n<p>The head of the tribe approaches, a gleam in his eye. His speech is thick and hypnotizing, an accent never heard on this earth.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Youuuu....want to seeeee....the <em>Butcher dance</em>, hey?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The professor nods.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We do the Butcher dance. We did it last night.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>They start to set up the camera. The chief says, &quot;but. We only do it. Once. Per. Year.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A hush.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, the professor knows not to argue. He knows he shouldn&#39;t make a scene. He&#39;s done this thousands of times. But he&#39;s never lost a friend, he&#39;s never come this far, he&#39;s never been this sunburned. With heavy heart, he stalks away in silence.</p>\n\n<p>He gets a flight home. He sees his wife and children. He gets on with his life.</p>\n\n<p>Months pass, but the dreams don&#39;t stop. He knows he will live a life of hollowness, a life of filling an unending hole, unless he can see this dance.</p>\n\n<p>Against the advice of every friend he&#39;s ever had, he books a flight to Australia the next year. He even gets some of his old crew to come along. They&#39;re excited, they&#39;re ready, there&#39;s the spirit in the air of &quot;well, we&#39;ve come this far!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And the excitement fades when they begin their trek. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s every bit as hard as last time. In fact, due to a sudden sandstorm, they are delayed a full day. There&#39;s the chance that they&#39;ll miss it, that the dance won&#39;t be performed for another year. </p>\n\n<p>Covered in bites and sand and blood, they stagger into the circle of walled stone.

Celebrating his tail off.\n\nSee, he'd spent the last 25 years cataloging every single dance performed by every group in the world. Polish Bogarodzicas. Sioux Buckskin dances to Seminole Green Corn dances. Inuit dances to the whales, Ghanaian Kpanlongo, Finnish step-dance. All of it. And he's found himself in Australia, recording the last one of all. A Wungubal in the north, performed by a small group of Aborigines. He taped it. He wrote it down. He was finally finished.\n\nHe's had a few beers to celebrate this, and the bartender asks what he's celebrating. The professor tells him, and also decides to buy the bar a round.\n\nA quiet man in a black suit and a bowler hat comes up to the bar, puts his hand on the anthropologist's shoulder, and whispers into his ear...\n\n\"You seen the *Butcher* dance yet, mate?\"\n\nThe professor admits he hasn't. But since he's seen every dance, he's sure he's taped it somewhere. The gentleman in the hat says, \"Noooooo, my friend. If you've seen it, you would remember it. It's only performed by this one tribe. Deep, deep, deep in the bush. Done by the Barrabarra tribe.\" \n\n\"But the Barrabarra have been extinct for half a century!\"\n\n\"No, mate. There's 30 of them left. And they're the last ones to do the Butcher dance.\"\n\nThe professor puts down his beer, runs to the car to get his film crew, and they ask the man for directions. He just NEEDS to see the Butcher dance. The directions are long and winding, and they tend to go on geological features instead of any compass readings. Pages and pages of directions.\n\n\"Pass a stone shaped like a dead woman's hand. Climb into the valley cut by the knife of the gods. Walk 20 miles by the light of the brightest star...\" etc.\n\nThey begin their trek. Days pass.\n\nThe better part of their sound equipment falls and shatters while they're climbing a gorge. After two weeks, he loses his first cameraman. Taipan bit him, and they were too far out to get any antidote. This utter tragedy only inflames the professor's desire, the price he must pay to see the mysterious Butcher dance. Their nights are freezing, their days are burned by the sun. And they finally come upon a fire within a circle of walled stone, surrounded by 30 shadowy figures.\n\nThe head of the tribe approaches, a gleam in his eye. His speech is thick and hypnotizing, an accent never heard on this earth.\n\n\"Youuuu....want to seeeee....the *Butcher dance*, hey?\"\n\nThe professor nods.\n\n\"We do the Butcher dance. We did it last night.\"\n\nThey start to set up the camera. The chief says, \"but. We only do it. Once. Per. Year.\"\n\nA hush.\n\nI mean, the professor knows not to argue. He knows he shouldn't make a scene. He's done this thousands of times. But he's never lost a friend, he's never come this far, he's never been this sunburned. With heavy heart, he stalks away in silence.\n\nHe gets a flight home. He sees his wife and children. He gets on with his life.\n\nMonths pass, but the dreams don't stop. He knows he will live a life of hollowness, a life of filling an unending hole, unless he can see this dance.\n\nAgainst the advice of every friend he's ever had, he books a flight to Australia the next year. He even gets some of his old crew to come along. They're excited, they're ready, there's the spirit in the air of \"well, we've come this far!\"\n\nAnd the excitement fades when they begin their trek. \n\nIt's every bit as hard as last time. In fact, due to a sudden sandstorm, they are delayed a full day. There's the chance that they'll miss it, that the dance won't be performed for another year. \n\nCovered in bites and sand and blood, they stagger into the circle of walled stone. There are the 30 figures. There is the fire. A drum is pounding, pounding up to the stars. The chief sees the professor and grins. \n\n\"We doing it tonight. I thought I'd see you. Prepare....for the *Butcher dance.*\"\n\nThe cameras are set up. \n\nThe sound is rolling.\n\nThe drums reach a monumental crescendo, mingling with their fevered heartbeats.\n\nThe chief pulls out a massive machete. He grabs a chicken that had been running around and he whocks off its head. He takes the still-moving body and slides the neck up his right arm. Bright crimson blood shines in the fire light. He does it on his other arm. He does it on his forehead. The drums fall silent. \n\nThe chief begins to sing. He sings...\n\n\n...\"Yooooooooou....\"\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\"Yooooooooou....\"\n\n...\n\n\n\"You *Butcher* right hand in.
