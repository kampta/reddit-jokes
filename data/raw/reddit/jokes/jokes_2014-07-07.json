When a stranger in his ford mustang boss 302 pulls up to the little Indian and proceeds to ask him \"Hey sir, would you like a ride?\" To which the little Indian man said\" I can't leave my bike behind\". looking over the little old Indians bike the stranger could only see one admirable quality which was a little shiny bell on the right handle bar. The stranger then says\" well we could just put the bike in the trunk and you can ride with me in the front. The little Indian agrees. Well, 15mins go by and there's no way the bike is going to fit in the trunk. But that doesn't stop the helpful enthusiastic  stranger. The stranger say to the little old Indian \" I have some rope that I can tie to your bike and my car so I could tow you to town\" the little old Indian shakes his head and say\"no..no..no, you drive to fast. The stranger replies\"you can just ring your bell if I'm driving to fast\". The little old Indian tired of the ride and the strangers persistence finally agrees. The ride back into town was smooth and other wise fine. They pull up to a red stop light when a corvette stingray pulls up and immediately starts revving his engine to which the stranger replies by revving his engine. The light turns green and both cars take off. A cop see this and immediately goes back to the station to tell what he had seen. He tells his chief and the chief reply\" what's so special about that. I see that shit all the time\" that's when the cop excitedly responds\"well, there was this little old Indian on a little pedal bike ringing his bell screaming obscenities at the top of his lungs
