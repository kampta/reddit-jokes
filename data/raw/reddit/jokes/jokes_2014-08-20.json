The prince was determined that there should be a theological spectacular wherein was exhibited the superiority of Christianity to Judaism, and if there could be no civilized debate, then the prince would have to send various emissaries into the village with the purpose of carrying out a slight theological pogrom.</p>\n\n<p>The village was in a hopeless quandary. The elders realized at once that unless someone was sent to debate the Jesuit, they would have more to fear than a single decapitation. But that single decapitation was a certainty: there were no men of learning in the village, no scholars, certainly no theological debaters. But someone would have to go\u2014never to return. The elders set about casting lots among themselves to choose a martyr, but before they finished they were approached by Berl, a poor, ignorant villager who earned his small livelihood mostly through the charity of the village. &quot;I will go,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>The elders were astonished, for, as one of them said, &quot;You, Berl, who did not complete even two years of elementary Hebrew school? How could you possibly debate this Jesuit champion?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; replied the usually excessively humble but now surprisingly confident Berl, &quot;I did not finish the second year of cheder, but I feel that I can do this.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The elders had a new quandary, another real moral problem. To accept Berl&#39;s self-nomination would be to send him to his death. But if not Berl, then who? No one from the village had a chance to prevail in any scholarly debate, and certainly not against such a fierce warrior-scholar as the priest promised to be. And if they sent no one, then the prince&#39;s minions would descend upon them all. Finally, after much discussion and even more weeping, they drew upon what little knowledge they had of Jewish law and the greater knowledge they took from fatalistic common sense and agreed that Berl would go. He assumed the task with modest pride.</p>\n\n<p>On the appointed day the entire village went with Berl to the palace of the prince. There they discovered that the formal apparatus of the debate was already in place. At the head of the large hall stood a great wooden chair in which sat the prince. Ahead of him and to his right was a small table, and behind the table sat the Jesuit theologian. Ahead of the prince and to his left was another table with a chair behind it meant for Berl. Between the two debaters&#39; tables stood a giant man, the prince&#39;s chief huntsman, and he leaned upon his immense ax.</p>\n\n<p>The sight terrified the villagers and they set up a hushed wailing as they took their positions, standing, at the rear of the hall. Berl went to the chair behind his table.</p>\n\n<p>The prince ordered the debate to begin. Customarily these debates begin with the flipping of a zloty coin, or some similar lot-casting, in order to decide who will ask the first question; but the priest saw at once that his opponent was a thoroughly unlearned man who could not possibly know any serious theology, and even so, the priest believed so firmly in the intellectual triumph of Christianity that he was sure he would prevail over any Jew who debated him, and so he said that he would give to the Jew the chance to ask the first question.</p>\n\n<p>Berl looked into the steely eyes of his opponent and in a small, barely audible voice said, &quot;What does this mean?- &#39;<em>Ani lo yodea</em>&#39;?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you do not know what this means, but the Jesuit priest was a master of biblical languages and many other languages as well, and of course he knew that this Hebrew sentence means &#39;I do not know&#39;, and he said at once, &quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Alas for the priest, the axman knew no Hebrew, and when he heard &quot;I do not know,&quot; he enforced the penalty for not knowing the answer to a question, and in a flash the head of the finest Christian theologian in all that part of Europe lay at the feet of the prince.</p>\n\n<p>The prince was aghast. The assembled people, Jews and Christians, were stunned. When the Jews had recovered they ran to the front of the room, hoisted Berl to their shoulders, and made their way home to their village as fast as they could.</p>\n\n<p>Once at home they went directly to the synagogue and offered countless prayers, including one improvised for the occasion, &quot;Words of thanksgiving from those recently delivered from Jesuit theology.&quot;  Afterward they repaired to the largest room in the village, in the study house, where they drank a little and sang and danced and congratulated Berl endlessly, always complimenting him on the immense subtlety of his question.</p>\n\n<p>At last one of the villagers had celebrated long enough for his curiosity and courage to rise, and he approached Berl, saying, &quot;Berl, you are a great man and your name will live forever; but I would like to ask you, master of the theological interrogation: how did you, a man who never passed through even the second year of cheder, how did you think of such a magnificent question?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is true,&quot; said Berl, &quot;that I completed but one year of cheder, but it was in cheder I learned that which saved us today. During that first year, one day the cheder was visited by a very famous man. It was Rabbi Weinstein, from Berlin, who was making a visit to our village to see an old aunt of his. The famous Rabbi Weinstein, the greatest scholar and teacher in Berlin, paid a brief visit to the cheder. When he stopped by me I was trying to read my Hebrew text. There was a sentence I could not translate, and so I said to the great scholar, &quot;Rabbi Weinstein, please, what does this mean-&#39;<em>Ani lo yodea</em>? And he said, &quot;I do not know.&quot; Today I thought, if even Rabbi Weinstein didn&#39;t know, then surely this Jesuit priest does not know.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>From: Cohen, T., 2008. <em>Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters</em>.

The elders set about casting lots among themselves to choose a martyr, but before they finished they were approached by Berl, a poor, ignorant villager who earned his small livelihood mostly through the charity of the village. \"I will go,\" he said.\n\nThe elders were astonished, for, as one of them said, \"You, Berl, who did not complete even two years of elementary Hebrew school? How could you possibly debate this Jesuit champion?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" replied the usually excessively humble but now surprisingly confident Berl, \"I did not finish the second year of cheder, but I feel that I can do this.\"\n\nThe elders had a new quandary, another real moral problem. To accept Berl's self-nomination would be to send him to his death. But if not Berl, then who? No one from the village had a chance to prevail in any scholarly debate, and certainly not against such a fierce warrior-scholar as the priest promised to be. And if they sent no one, then the prince's minions would descend upon them all. Finally, after much discussion and even more weeping, they drew upon what little knowledge they had of Jewish law and the greater knowledge they took from fatalistic common sense and agreed that Berl would go. He assumed the task with modest pride.\n\nOn the appointed day the entire village went with Berl to the palace of the prince. There they discovered that the formal apparatus of the debate was already in place. At the head of the large hall stood a great wooden chair in which sat the prince. Ahead of him and to his right was a small table, and behind the table sat the Jesuit theologian. Ahead of the prince and to his left was another table with a chair behind it meant for Berl. Between the two debaters' tables stood a giant man, the prince's chief huntsman, and he leaned upon his immense ax.\n\nThe sight terrified the villagers and they set up a hushed wailing as they took their positions, standing, at the rear of the hall. Berl went to the chair behind his table.\n\nThe prince ordered the debate to begin. Customarily these debates begin with the flipping of a zloty coin, or some similar lot-casting, in order to decide who will ask the first question; but the priest saw at once that his opponent was a thoroughly unlearned man who could not possibly know any serious theology, and even so, the priest believed so firmly in the intellectual triumph of Christianity that he was sure he would prevail over any Jew who debated him, and so he said that he would give to the Jew the chance to ask the first question.\n\nBerl looked into the steely eyes of his opponent and in a small, barely audible voice said, \"What does this mean?- '*Ani lo yodea*'?\"\n\nPerhaps you do not know what this means, but the Jesuit priest was a master of biblical languages and many other languages as well, and of course he knew that this Hebrew sentence means 'I do not know', and he said at once, \"I do not know.\"\n\nAlas for the priest, the axman knew no Hebrew, and when he heard \"I do not know,\" he enforced the penalty for not knowing the answer to a question, and in a flash the head of the finest Christian theologian in all that part of Europe lay at the feet of the prince.\n\nThe prince was aghast. The assembled people, Jews and Christians, were stunned. When the Jews had recovered they ran to the front of the room, hoisted Berl to their shoulders, and made their way home to their village as fast as they could.\n \nOnce at home they went directly to the synagogue and offered countless prayers, including one improvised for the occasion, \"Words of thanksgiving from those recently delivered from Jesuit theology.\"  Afterward they repaired to the largest room in the village, in the study house, where they drank a little and sang and danced and congratulated Berl endlessly, always complimenting him on the immense subtlety of his question.\n\nAt last one of the villagers had celebrated long enough for his curiosity and courage to rise, and he approached Berl, saying, \"Berl, you are a great man and your name will live forever; but I would like to ask you, master of the theological interrogation: how did you, a man who never passed through even the second year of cheder, how did you think of such a magnificent question?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Berl, \"that I completed but one year of cheder, but it was in cheder I learned that which saved us today. During that first year, one day the cheder was visited by a very famous man. It was Rabbi Weinstein, from Berlin, who was making a visit to our village to see an old aunt of his. The famous Rabbi Weinstein, the greatest scholar and teacher in Berlin, paid a brief visit to the cheder. When he stopped by me I was trying to read my Hebrew text. There was a sentence I could not translate, and so I said to the great scholar, \"Rabbi Weinstein, please, what does this mean-'*Ani lo yodea*? And he said, \"I do not know.\" Today I thought, if even Rabbi Weinstein didn't know, then surely this Jesuit priest does not know.\"\n\nFrom: Cohen, T., 2008. *Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters*. University of Chicago Press.
