The blonde clears her throat, the cameras are turned on and the quiz begins.\n\n\"Question 1,\" the first judge bellows, \"is a question in higher level physics.\" The blonde nods cautiously and the judge continues. \"Using only pencil, paper and the most powerful calculator we can find, derive a formula to explain how many dimensions exist in the universe and explain how it relates to the evolution of space-time according to Einstein's Theory of Relativity.\"\n\nThe blonde immediately begins to sweat, but does not lose her composure. She takes the pencil, some paper and the calculator and stares intently at the paper, deep in thought. The judges wait, the crowd begins becoming restless. After about an hour of silence, the blonde looks up, disheartened. \"I'm afraid I don't know.\"\n\nA groan of disappointment emanates through the crowd, but is quickly followed by enthusiastic chanting and cheering: \"Give her another chance! Give her another chance!\"\n\nThe sheer ruckus of the crowd causes the judges to huddle together and discuss the situation. They decide that the question was somewhat unfair to ask one poor girl working alone, and they rule to throw out the question and ask a new one. The crowd screams with delight and quickly settles down.\n\n\"Your next question,\" the second judge asks, \"is in the category of sports. I want you to tell me which team it was that won the third Superbowl in history.\"\n\nThe blonde takes her papers and pencil once more and begins making a few drawings and charts as she digs through her brain for the answer. After about two hours, she looks up, on the verge of tears. \"I'm sorry,\" she murmurs, \"I don't know that either.\"\n\nThe audience gasps in shock. However, the spirit of the blondes is still strong. \"Give her another chance! Give her another chance!\"\n\nThe judges confer once more in order to decide what to do while the noise of the crowd rises. Eventually, in order to appease the audience the judges decide to ask one more question. The crowd quickly settles and the judges think of a way to end the quiz quickly before the audience becomes unruly.\n\n\"Your next question,\" says the third judge, slightly exhausted, \"is in mathematics. What is... two times two?\"\n\nThe blonde immediately takes her pencil in hand and begins scribbling furiously over the paper. She writes and writes with unmatched fervor, jotting away and calculating rapidly. One hour passes, then two hours as she continues working nonstop. Finally, after three hours the judges become impatient and demand an answer. After a few quick last-minute notes, the blonde sets her pencil down and nods confidently. The judges wait on the edge of their seats for her response. \"The answer is four!\" the blonde proclaims triumphantly.\n\n\"Give her another chance! Give her another chance!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Blonde Smarts", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_ivszg", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ivszg/blonde_smarts/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "ivszg", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "orangegluon", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ivszg/blonde_smarts/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1311284207.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ivszg/blonde_smarts/", "created_utc": 1311255407.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Muzzles off!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Muzzles off!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What do Jewish pitbulls say to each other when they get home?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_ivrt9", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ivrt9/what_do_jewish_pitbulls_say_to_each_other_when/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "ivrt9", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kingnutter", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ivrt9/what_do_jewish_pitbulls_say_to_each_other_when/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1311280977.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ivrt9/what_do_jewish_pitbulls_say_to_each_other_when/", "created_utc": 1311252177.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A fat guy Paul saw &quot;lose 5kg in a week&quot; in newspaper. </p>\n\n<p>He calls the company &amp; lady says be ready tomorrow at 6 am. </p>\n\n<p>The next morning paul opens the door &amp; finds a hot babe vid just shoes, underpants &amp; shirt saying &quot;u catch me u f**k me! &amp; the girl starts running.
