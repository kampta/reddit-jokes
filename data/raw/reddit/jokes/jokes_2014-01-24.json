She doesn't know which one to get so she just grabs one and \ngoes over to the counter. A Wal-Mart associate is standing there wearing\ndark shades.\n\nShe says, \"Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me anything about this rod\nand reel?\"\n\nHe says, \"Ma'am, I'm completely blind; but if you'll drop it on the\ncounter, I can tell you everything you need to know about it from the \nsound it makes.\n\nShe doesn't believe him but drops it on the counter anyway.\n\nHe says, \"That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404\nreel and 10-lb Test line. It's a good all around combination; and it's\non sale this week for only $20.00.\"\n\nShe says, \"It's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound\nof it dropping on the counter. I'll take it!\" As she opens her purse, her\ncredit card drops on the floor.\n\n\"Oh, that sounds like a Master Card,\" he says.\n\nShe bends down to pick it up and accidentally breaks wind. At first\nshe is really embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way the blind clerk\ncould tell it was she who farted. Being blind, he wouldn't know that she\nwas the only person around.\n\nThe man rings up the sale and says, \"That'll be $34.50 please. \"\n\nThe woman is totally confused by this and asks, \"Didn't you tell me it was on sale for $20.00? How did you get $34.50?\"\n\nHe replies, \"Yes, Ma'am. The rod and reel is $20.00, but the Duck\nCall Is $11.00 and the Catfish Bait is $3.50.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "The blind Walmart clerk", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1w029d", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1w029d/the_blind_walmart_clerk/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1w029d", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stoutshako42ref", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 583, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1w029d/the_blind_walmart_clerk/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1390561465.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1w029d/the_blind_walmart_clerk/", "created_utc": 1390532665.0, "ups": 583, "num_comments": 44}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The devil takes his new arival on a tour...</p>\n\n<p>He then explains to the man their are options how you can spend your eternity here .</p>\n\n<p>They walk along a corridor and the devil says you can choose anyone you like but you may only choose one and can not switch!</p>\n\n<p>Behind the first door are people being penetrated by pineapples</p>\n\n<p>The next door they are being chased by demons</p>\n\n<p>The following room people standing knee high in shit drinking coffie</p>\n\n<p>In the last room a man sitting in a recliner drinking beer watching TV getting his dick sucked by a beautiful blond woman</p>\n\n<p>The man says devil this is to be my punishment</p>\n\n<p>The Devil says , are you sure?

Terrorists have been re-categorized from \"Tiresome\" to \"A Bloody Nuisance.\"\n\nThe last time the British issued a \"Bloody Nuisance\" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.\n\nThe Scots have raised their threat level from \"Pissed Off\" to \"Let's get the Bastards.\" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.\n\nThe French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from \"Run\" to \"Hide.\" They only two higher levels in France are \"Collaborate\" and \"Surrender.\" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.\n\nItaly has increased the alert level from \"Shout Loudly and Excitedly\" to \"Elaborate Military Posturing.\" Two more levels remain: \"Ineffective Combat Operations\" and \"Change Sides.\"\n\nThe Germans have increased their alert state from \"Disdainful Arrogance\" to \"Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.\" They also have two higher levels: \"Invade a Neighbor\" and \"Lose.\"\n\nBelgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual and the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.\n\nThe Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from \"No worries\" to \"She'll be alright, Mate.\" Three more escalation levels remain: \"Crikey!\", \"I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend\", and \"The barbie is cancelled.\"\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Terror Alerts - by John Cleese", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1vzv42", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1vzv42/terror_alerts_by_john_cleese/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1vzv42", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tech-Mechanic", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 137, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1vzv42/terror_alerts_by_john_cleese/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1390557104.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1vzv42/terror_alerts_by_john_cleese/", "created_utc": 1390528304.0, "ups": 137, "num_comments": 8}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>... when she wears a Malcolm X jacket helicopters try to land on her back. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "... when she wears a Malcolm X jacket helicopters try to land on her back.
