He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued\nand said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed and there\nwas no need for his good time to be spoiled by her not going. So he\ntook his costume and away he went.\n\nThe wife, after sleeping soundly for about an hour, woke without pain,\nand as it was still early, decided to go to the party.\n\nAs her husband didn't know what her costume was, she thought she would\nhave some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was\nnot with him.\n\nSo she joined the party and soon spotted her husband in his\ncostume, cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice \"chick\"\nhe could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there.\n\nHis wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he\nleft his new partner high and dry and devoted his time to her.\nShe let him go as far as he wished, naturally, since he was her\nhusband. After more drinks he finally whispered a little proposition\nin her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had\npassionate intercourse in the back seat.\nJust before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and\nput the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of\nexplanation he would make up for his outrageous behaviour.\n\nShe was sitting up reading when he came in, so she asked what\nkind of time he had. \"Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good\ntime when you're not there.\"\nThen she asked,\" Did you dance much?\"\nHe replied, I'll tell you; I never even danced one dance.\nWhen I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went\ninto the spare room and played poker all evening.\n\" You must have looked really silly wearing that costume playingpoker\nall night!\" she said with unashamed sarcasm. To which the husband\nreplied, \"Actually, I gave my costume to our neighbor, Sam. When he gave back the costume, he said he had the time of his life\"!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked":
