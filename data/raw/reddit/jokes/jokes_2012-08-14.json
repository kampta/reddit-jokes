I haven't smoked in forever!\"\nKoala, being a pretty chill dude, says \"sure man!\" And lizard climbed the tree and joined him.\nThey'd been at it for a while when lizard suddenly gets thirsty. He heads to the river after promising to Koala that he'd return.\nOnce at the river, he sees crocadile. Crocadile notices that lizard is tottering around, stoned out of his mind, and says \"hey lizard, you want to share?\" Lizard of course refers him to koala, and proceeds to take a nap next to the river.\nCrocodile walks up to Koala's tree, and shouts up to him, \"Hey Koala!\" Koala looks down the tree, and shouts back, \"Damn Lizard!
