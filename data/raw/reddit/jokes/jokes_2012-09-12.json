Bad traffic, a malfunctioning computer, incompetent coworkers and a sore back all made me a seething cauldron of rage. But more importantly for this story, it had been over forty-eight hours since I&#39;d last taken a dump. I&#39;d tried to jumpstart the process, beginning my day with a bowl of ass cleansing fiber cereal, following it with six cups of coffee at work, and adding a bean-laden lunch at Taco Bell. As I was returning home from work, my insides let me know with subtle rumbles and the emission of the occasional tiny fart that Big Things would be happening soon. </p>\n\n<p>Alas, I had to stop at the mall to pick up an order for the wife.

I hurried to the mall bathrooms. I surveyed the five stalls, which I have numbered 1 through 5 for your convenience: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Occupied. </li>\n<li>Clean, but Bathroom Protocol forbids its use, as it&#39;s next to the occupied one. </li>\n<li>Poop smeared on seat. </li>\n<li>Poop and toilet paper in bowl, unidentifiable liquid splattered on seat. </li>\n<li>No toilet paper, no stall door, something growing near base of toilet. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Clearly, it had to be Stall #2. I trudged back, entered, dropped trou and sat down. I&#39;m normally a fairly Shameful Pooper. I wasn&#39;t happy about being next to the occupied stall, but Big Things were afoot. </p>\n\n<p>I was just getting ready to bear down when all of a sudden the sweet sounds of Beethoven came from next door, followed by a fumbling, and then the sound of a voice answering the ringing phone. As usual for a cell phone conversation, the voice was exactly 8 dB louder than it needed to be. </p>\n\n<p>Out of Shameful habit, my sphincter slammed shut. The inane conversation went on and on. Mr. Pooper was blathering to Mrs. Pooper about the crappy day he had. I sat there, cramping and miserable, waiting for him to finish. As the loud conversation dragged on, I became angrier and angrier, thinking that I, too, had a crappy day, but I was too polite to yak about in public. </p>\n\n<p>My ass let me know in no uncertain terms that if I didn&#39;t get crapping soon, my day would be getting even crappier. </p>\n\n<p>Finally my anger reached a point that overcame Shamefulness. I no longer cared. I gripped the toilet paper holder with one hand, braced my other hand against the side of the stall, and pushed with all my might. I was rewarded with a fart of colossal magnitude -- a cross between the sound of someone ripping a very wet bed sheet in half and of plywood being torn off a wall. The sound gradually transitioned into a heavily modulated low-RPM tone, not unlike someone firing up a Harley. I managed to hit the resonance frequency of the stall, and it shook gently. </p>\n\n<p>Once my ass cheeks stopped flapping in the breeze, three things became apparent: </p>\n\n<p>(1) The next-door conversation had ceased; (2) my colon&#39;s continued seizing indicated that there was more to come; and (3) the bathroom was now beset by a horrible, eldritch stench. </p>\n\n<p>It was as if a gateway to Hell had been opened. The foul miasma quickly made its way under the stall and began choking my poop-mate. This initial &quot;herald&quot; fart had ended his conversation in mid-sentence. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh my God,&quot; I heard him utter, following it with suppressed sounds of choking, and then, &quot;No, baby, that wasn&#39;t me (cough, gag), you could hear that (gag)??&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Now there was no stopping me. I pushed for all I was worth. I could swear that in the resulting cacophony of rips, squirts, splashes, poots, and blasts, I was actually lifted slightly off the pot. The amount of stuff in me was incredible. It sprayed against the bowl with tremendous force. </p>\n\n<p>Later, in surveying the damage, I&#39;d see that liquid poop had actually managed to ricochet out of the bowl and run down the side on to the floor. But for now, all I could do was hang on for the ride. </p>\n\n<p>Next door I could hear him fumbling with the paper dispenser as he desperately tried to finish his task. Little snatches of conversation made themselves heard over my anal symphony: &quot;Gotta go... horrible... throw up... in my mouth... not... make it... tell the kids... love them... oh God...&quot; followed by more sounds of suppressed gagging and retching. </p>\n\n<p>Alas, it is evidently difficult to hold one&#39;s phone and wipe one&#39;s bum at the same time. Just as my high-pressure abuse of the toilet was winding down, I heard a plop and splash from next door, followed by string of swear words and gags. My shit-mate had dropped his phone into the toilet. </p>\n\n<p>There was a lull in my production, and the restroom became deathly quiet. I could envision him standing there, wondering what to do. A final anal announcement came trumpeting from my behind, small chunks plopping noisily into the water. That must have been the last straw. I heard a flush, a fumbling with the lock, and then the stall door was thrown open. I heard him running out of the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. </p>\n\n<p>After a considerable amount of paperwork, I got up and surveyed the damage. I felt bad for the janitor who&#39;d be forced to deal with this, but I knew that flushing was not an option. No toilet in the world could handle that unholy mess.
