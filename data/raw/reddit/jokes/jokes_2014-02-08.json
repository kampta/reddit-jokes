The astronauts start talking to the Martians about various things, culture, history, etc. until the topic of sex comes up. They discover that Martians have sex just like humans. In the name of science, they decide to swap partners for the evening.\n\nCut to the human female with the Martian male. The Martian male takes off his pants to reveal a micropenis. The human female says \"Wow, that's very small! I don't think this is going to work.\"\n\nMartian male: \"Oh, sorry! Hold on a sec!\" He begins slapping himself on the forehead, and each time he slaps himself his penis gets a little longer.\n\nHuman female: \"Wow, that's impressive! But it's still very thin.\"\n\nMartian male: \"Oh, sorry! Hold on a sec!\" He begins pulling on his ears, and every time he pulls on his ears his penis becomes a little wider.
