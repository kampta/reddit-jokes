They light the campfire, eat a meal, drink some champagne, and go to the tent to sleep.\n\nLater that night, Sherlock wakes Watson up.\n\n\"Watson, look up at the sky.\" he says. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\"I see lots and lots of stars\" he replies.\n\n\"And what does that tell you?\" Sherlock asks.\n\n\"Astronomically, it suggests to me that if there are billions of other galaxies that have roughly similar stellar population densities as represented by my view, that, potentially, trillions of planets may be associated with such a galactic and, therefore, stellar population. Allowing for similar chemical distribution throughout the cosmos it may be reasonably implied that life-and possibly intelligent life-may well fill the universe. Also, being a believer, theologically, it tells me that the vastness of space may be yet another suggestion of the greatness of God and that we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, the blackness of the sky and the crispness of the stellar images tells me that there is low humidity and stable air and therefore we are most likely to enjoy a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you, Sherlock?\"\n\n\"No Watson, you idiot, someone has stolen the damn tent!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0,
