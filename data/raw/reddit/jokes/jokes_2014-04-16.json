There, just over the next sand dune is a house, with vegetation growing around it. &quot;How do we know that it&#39;s not a mirage?&quot; the second guy skeptically asks. They decide that one of them should go check it out, because they don&#39;t have the energy to all go. They do rock-paper-scissors, and the first guy is selected to go see if the house is real.</p>\n\n<p>He walks over to the house, and decides that it is real. He steps forward and rings the doorbell. After a few moments, the door swings open to reveal the most disgusting, ugly woman the man has ever seen. She has warts and zits all over her butterface, disgusting wrinkly skin, deflated tits, and is generally smelly and dirty. <em>0/10, would feed to pet alligator</em>, the first guy thinks, realizing his thinking habits that he picked up on reddit won&#39;t do him any good in the desert. </p>\n\n<p>He holds in a gag, shakes of the dizzying nausea, and says, &quot;Hello, my friends and I are lost in the desert and are close to death. Is there any way you could give us some water?&quot; The woman/garbage pile replies &quot;Of course, but only if you have sex with me.&quot; The man takes a moment to process what she is saying, and promptly faints, soon standing back up again and getting the hell away from her. He goes back to his friends and says, &quot;No luck, but the house is real all right. Why don&#39;t one of you try?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The second man goes up, rings the bell, and is presented with the disgusting woman.

There, just over the next sand dune is a house, with vegetation growing around it. \"How do we know that it's not a mirage?\" the second guy skeptically asks. They decide that one of them should go check it out, because they don't have the energy to all go. They do rock-paper-scissors, and the first guy is selected to go see if the house is real.\n\nHe walks over to the house, and decides that it is real. He steps forward and rings the doorbell. After a few moments, the door swings open to reveal the most disgusting, ugly woman the man has ever seen. She has warts and zits all over her butterface, disgusting wrinkly skin, deflated tits, and is generally smelly and dirty. *0/10, would feed to pet alligator*, the first guy thinks, realizing his thinking habits that he picked up on reddit won't do him any good in the desert. \n\nHe holds in a gag, shakes of the dizzying nausea, and says, \"Hello, my friends and I are lost in the desert and are close to death. Is there any way you could give us some water?\" The woman/garbage pile replies \"Of course, but only if you have sex with me.\" The man takes a moment to process what she is saying, and promptly faints, soon standing back up again and getting the hell away from her.
