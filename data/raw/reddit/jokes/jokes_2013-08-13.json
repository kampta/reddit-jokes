Steven was lost in the mountains of Bolivia one day. He had embarked from Lima weeks ago, but his translator had taken a rather nasty tumble and was no longer with him. But the Rabbi continued.

So he decided to follow it for as long as he could. </p>\n\n<p>He walked for another day, until he came across a tiny village on a small island in the middle of the river. And tiny means tiny, literally miniature. The small twig huts were only a few inches tall each. The largest about two feet, and the smallest about half a foot. This, of course, intrigued Steven, so he waded into the river, and crossed to the island. When there, he realised what a state of disrepair many of the buildings were in. They were all dust free, but most of them had holes in them, or entire portions missing. It appeared as though a mini tornado had passed through. </p>\n\n<p>He carefully walked around the little village until he stumbled (almost literally) upon a very small, barbaric, hospital. When he listened carefully, he could hear tiny shouts of agony coming from within. He, very lightly, tapped on the door, and a little person, no more than 3 inches tall, stepped out. She was dressed in doctor-like clothes, and had some tiny pink splotches of blood plastered on her clothing. She looked up at the Rabbi, and let out a tiny shriek.

It stepped out into the street, and though it was visibly shaking, it yelled up to him, &quot;we don&#39;t have any more fire crystals!

So the Trids gathered their militia and sent them up, but they got kicked right back down the mountain. Then the Trids gathered their farmers and workers, and sent them up the mountain, but they all got kicked back down. And by the time they were ready to send another wave they realised that they only had a handful of doctors left uninjured.\nAnd so the rabbi offered to help, he&#39;d get the fire crystal back.
