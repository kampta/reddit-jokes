wrong and he says when he was at school, while peeing something came out of his penis, the mom explains everything and cools him down.  \n A couple of days later the second kid comes home with the same story and she explains everything to him as well.   \nSometime later the third kid comes into the house scared to death and crying, Mom asks:\"what's the matter honey ? did something weird happen when you were peeing? \" and the kid responds:\"No, I was jerking off in the yard and suddenly I shot the dog\"  \n*edit: formatting*\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [],
