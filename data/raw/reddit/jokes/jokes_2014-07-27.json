And then, finally she comes over closer to me and she says: \n\n\"I apologize for staring, that must have been annoying. I, I... You look so much like my son, who died. I just can't take my eyes off you.\"\n\n And she procedes to go into her purse and she pulls out a photograph of her son who'd died. And uh, he looks absolutely nothing like me. In fact he's... Chinese... anyway, we chatted a little bit. And she says: \n\n\"I'm sorry, I have to ask you. Would you mind, as I leave the supermarket here, would you mind saying \"Goodbye mom\" to me? I, I know it's a strange request but I haven't heard my son saying \"Goodbye mom\" to me, and \"So long\" and it would mean so much to me to hear it. And uh, if you don't mind I... \"\n\n And I said: \"Well, you know, okay, yeah, sure. Eh.. uh... I can say that.\" \n\nAnd, and so, she gets her groceries all checked out. And as she's going out the door she waves at me and she hollers across the store: \n\n\"Goodbye son!\" And I look up and I wave and I say: \n\n\"Goodbye mom!\" And then she goes, So I get my few things there, on the conveyor belt and the checker checks out my things. And he gives me the total and he says: \n\n\"That'll be four hundred and seventy nine dollars.\" And I said: \n\n\"Well, how is that possible! I've only got a little tuna fish, and uh some skimmed milk, and uh mustard and a loaf of bread...\" He goes:\n\n \"Well, well you're also paying for the groceries for your mother. She uh, told me you'd take care of the bill for her.\" And I said:\n\n \"Well, wait a minute! That's not my mother!\" And he says:\n\n \"Well I distinctly heard her say as she left the store \"Bye son!\" and you said \"Bye mom!\" and so what are you trying to say here, uh...\" I said:\n\n \"Well, JESUS!\" \n\nAnd I looked out into the parking lot and she was just getting into her car. \n\nAnd I ran out there.

Now there is this level 0 cheerio. Hes homeless, living out on the street, probably an alcoholic. But he falls in love with a frosted cheerio princess. So one day he sneaks into the royal gala and goes up to the princess and asks her &quot;will you marry me?&quot; Now she says &quot;I like your style, you&#39;re a good looking guy, a bit scruffy but I like you. Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio&quot; So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts. Now by having a job and his debts paid he becomes a level 1 cheerio. So he works, and he works, and he works, and he WORKS and he finally becomes a level 2 cheerio. Now he goes back to the princess and asks her again, &quot;will you marry me?&quot; she says &quot;no honey you really do have to become a frosted cheerio first.&quot; So he goes back and he works and works, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, I don&#39;t care.

But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS.

He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio. So he goes to the princess and asks her again, &quot;will you marry me?&quot; and she says &quot;Yes I will marry you now.&quot; So a few months pass and they&#39;re at the wedding reception, they already said their vows and the party is winding down.

It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in line only to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda.
