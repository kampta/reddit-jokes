Because he had never done this before, he consults the pharmacist on which brand he should get.  They talk a while about which brands are best for what, given his size, how much sex he's planning to have, how kinky it will be, etc.  Eventually John decides on the Family Pack, figuring it covered all his bases.\n\nJohn arrives at Alexa's house that night and he, Alexa, and the parents sit down for dinner.  Alexa's father asks John if he'd like to say grace.  John nervously bows his head and goes on and on thanking the Lord for the dinner, thanking Alexa's parents for their hospitality.
