There, he surprised her in the produce department, and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands. As the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath, and slumped to the floor, the manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the scene.\n\nUnwilling to leave any witnesses behind, Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well.\n\nUnknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured by hidden cameras and observed by the store's security guard, who immediately called the police.\n\nArtie was caught and arrested before he could leave the store.\n\nUnder intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the sordid plan, including his financial arrangements with the hapless husband.\n\nAnd that is why, the next day in the newspaper, the headline declared...........\n\n\n\"ARTIE CHOKES TWO FOR A DOLLAR AT SAFEWAY.\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Artichokes", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_q7h1l", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/q7h1l/artichokes/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "q7h1l", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "73616E6A6179", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 38, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/q7h1l/artichokes/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1330336669.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/q7h1l/artichokes/", "created_utc": 1330307869.0, "ups": 38, "num_comments": 5}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>King Arthur was getting ready to go on a Quest.
