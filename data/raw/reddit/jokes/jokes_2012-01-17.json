The ordinary, typical grey elephant. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s African or Asian, one tusk or two, it&#39;s still a grey elephant. There&#39;s also the blue elephant. Not many people have seen a blue elephant, and that&#39;s surprising because anybody can catch a blue elephant. They don&#39;t run, they don&#39;t squeal, they just stand there and look blue. The third type is the pink elephant. Many claim to have seen a pink elephant, but there aren&#39;t many people that really have. Pink elephants are the rarest elephants, and they hide deep within the jungles, farther in than the elusive blue elephant. Nobody has ever caught a pink elephant, except me. And I&#39;m going to tell you how.</p>\n\n<p>Everybody knows grey elephants like peanuts. Pink elephants, however, like raisins. The only greater thing in the world to a pink elephant than a raisin is more raisins. When a pink elephant finds a raisin, it just goes crazy with happiness. </p>\n\n<p>The first trick to catching a pink elephant is to make a cake and put three raisins on top of it. Just three. Then you travel across the ocean to Africa, up the river, past the grey elephants, through the jungle, past the blue elephants, because anybody can catch a blue elephant, up a waterfall and end up in pink elephant territory. Once there; find a clearing in the jungle, put the raisin cake in the centre, go hide and wait.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, a pink elephant will come along, happy as can be, having caught the scent of raisins. When the pink elephant finds your cake, it&#39;ll squeal and dance with glee, and eat the whole cake. Once it&#39;s done, it&#39;ll head off, being really happy at having gotten three raisins.</p>\n\n<p>Once the pink elephant has eaten the cake and run off, go back down the waterfall, past the blue elephants, because anybody can catch a blue elephant, through the jungle, down the river, past the grey elephants, across the ocean and all the way home.</p>\n\n<p>Now bake a cake with only two raisins on top. Then you travel back across the ocean to Africa, up the river, past the grey elephants, through the jungle, past the blue elephants, because anybody can catch a blue elephant, up a waterfall and end up in pink elephant territory.

Doesn't matter if it's African or Asian, one tusk or two, it's still a grey elephant. There's also the blue elephant. Not many people have seen a blue elephant, and that's surprising because anybody can catch a blue elephant. They don't run, they don't squeal, they just stand there and look blue. The third type is the pink elephant. Many claim to have seen a pink elephant, but there aren't many people that really have. Pink elephants are the rarest elephants, and they hide deep within the jungles, farther in than the elusive blue elephant. Nobody has ever caught a pink elephant, except me. And I'm going to tell you how.\n\nEverybody knows grey elephants like peanuts. Pink elephants, however, like raisins. The only greater thing in the world to a pink elephant than a raisin is more raisins. When a pink elephant finds a raisin, it just goes crazy with happiness. \n\nThe first trick to catching a pink elephant is to make a cake and put three raisins on top of it. Just three.
