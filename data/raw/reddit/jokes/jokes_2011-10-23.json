The officer gets up, grabs the small man from behind and easily flips him over his shoulder, slamming him onto the floor. \n \"That is Judo, from Japan!\" he says, then walks back to the bar to resume drinking. \n A few drinks later, he notices the small man again, and once more announces he has something to show everyone. The officer ambles over and does an open palm strike on the small man's face, knocking him from his stool. \n \"That was Kung-Fu from China!\" he announces, then resumes his drinking. \nA bit later the naval officer has become quite inebriated and decides its time to show that little punk who's boss so he gets up and staggers over, gives the little man two quick strikes and a round house kick, knocking him once more off his stool. \n \" That was Muay Thai kick boxing from  Thailand!\"\n \n Well, the little man pulls himself up and staggers out the door seemingly having had enough of the douchebag navy guy. \n The officer has a drunken laugh before going back to drinking. \n\n A few moments later the little guy returns, a crowbar in his hand and before anyone can react he quickly slams it into the Navy officer's ribs, sweeping him off his bar stool. Two bone crunching swipes later the officer is out cold on the floor and the little guy looks around at the rest of the bar. \n\n \"When he wakes up,\" the little guy announces to the awe-struck bar. \"You tell him that was a crowbar from Sears & Roebuck!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Don't pick on the little guy.
