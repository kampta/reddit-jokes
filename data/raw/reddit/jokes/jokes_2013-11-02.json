Now go tell your mom that I&#39;ll be down in a minute.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The little boy wonders back downstairs to tell his mom. He walks into the kitchen where his mom is stuffing the turkey.

His mother walks in the room and asks him to put his toys away. She tells him his grandparents are on the way and asks if he can go check on his brothers and dad to see if they're ready. The little boy obeys and wonders off to his brothers room. His brother is quite a bit older and has his girlfriend over. As he's getting closer he hears the two yelling.\n\n\"You're a BITCH!\"\n\n\"YOU'RE A BASTARD!\"\n\nThe little boy, not understanding what's going on, walks into the room oblivious to what's going on. He looks up at his brother and asks \"what's a bitch?\" His brother, seriously flustered at being interrupted, stammers out \"uhhh it's just a nice thing to call a girl\" the little boy accepts the answer and asks \"well then what's a bastard?\" the brother tells him \"that's just.. uhh.. the same thing except for a boy\" the little boy accepts the answer and tells his brother that his grandma and grandpa are on their way.\n\nThe little boy goes down the hall to his other brothers room, who is also quite a bit older, and also has his girlfriend over. He hears yelling coming from that room too and gets closer to hear what's going on. \n\n\"OH GOD LET ME FEEL YOUR DICK!\"\n\n\"UNNHNHHHGGHHH YOU HAVE THE NICEST TITS!\"\n\nThe little boy, oblivious to what\u2019s happening, barges in and hears a loud screech come from his brother. His brother yells at him to get out but the little boy insists on knowing what a dick and tits are. The big brother infuriated by being cock blocked by his brother spouts off \"it's just a hat and a coat now get out of here!\"\n\nThe little boy obviously confused by all of this continues down the hall to his parent room. He walks in quietly on his dad shaving and starts to tell him about the grandparent's. The dad, not realizing the little boy had been there is startled and lets out a loud\n\n\"OH SHIT!\"\n\nThe little boy jumps back, being startled himself. He looks up at his dad and says \"What's shit daddy?\" his dad looks down confused and frustrated. Coming up with something on the spot he tells the boy \"It's just the new shaving cream I'm using. Now go tell your mom that I'll be down in a minute.\"\n\nThe little boy wonders back downstairs to tell his mom. He walks into the kitchen where his mom is stuffing the turkey. Knowing he had scared his dad he thought it would be funny to try the same trick on his mom. He sneaks up on his mom and yells \"BOO!\" She jumped up and lets out a extremely loud \n\n\"OH FUUUUCK!\"\n\nThe little boy snickers at scaring his mom and tells her that his dad will be down in a minute. After that he asks her \"what's a fuck?\" his mom tells him \"It's the kind of stuffing I'm using in the turkey.\" \n\nAfter this exchange the little boy hears the doorbell ring.
