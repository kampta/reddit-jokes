The woman loves cars, and especially loves that Mercedes, so she proceeds to stare at the entrance hoping the man who owns it will come in. \n\nFinally a full ten minutes later a man comes into the bar. He looks around and sees the beautiful woman staring at him, he smiles and walks over to her and says. \"Do you see that Mercedes out front? I...\" but before he could get any further the woman says. \"I will fuck you right now if you let me drive that car.\" The man is obviously shocked but thinks about it, smiles and says, \"Okay but it has to be right now.\" So the woman immediately takes the man into the bathroom and has furious sex with him. \n\nThey come out of the bathroom smiling, then she sees her husband. She only continues to smile and says \"well if you remembered it was my birthday none of this would've happened.\" The man walks up to the husband hands him a $20 dollar bill and says he can't accept this, throws the keys to the woman and says happy birthday from your loving husband.
