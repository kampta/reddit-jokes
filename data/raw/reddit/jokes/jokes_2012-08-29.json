But just then she heard a knock on the front door. So she left her pink room, walked down the pink hallway, down the pink staircase, to the pink front door and turned the pink doorknob. To her surprise, there was Mr. Green at her doorstep!\n\n\"It seems my car has broken down,\" said Mr. Green. \"Would you be so kind as to let me stay the night?\"\n\n\"Why certainly!\" replied Mrs. Pink.\n\nSo she lead him through the pink front door, up the pink staircase, down the pink hallway and to the second pink door on the right. She turned the pink doorknob on the pink door and motioned him in.\n\n\"I'm sure you'll be comfortable here for the night,\" she chimed.\nWith her new guest taken care of, she went back to the first pink room and lay down in her pink bed. She was just drifting off to sleep when she heard another knock at the front door. Bewildered, she left her pink room, walked down the pink hallway, down the pink staircase, to the pink front door and turned the pink doorknob. \n\nWhen she opened the pink front door she was met by the smiling face of Mr. Black!\n\n\"Sorry to wake you at such an hour but my car has broken down and I have nowhere to stay,\" said Mr. Black.\n\n\"Well then you must stay here for the night!\" Beamed Mrs. Pink.\n\nSo she lead him through the pink front door, up the pink staircase, down the pink hallway and to the third pink door on the right. She turned the pink doorknob on the pink door and let him into the pink bedroom.\n\n\"You'll find yourself right at home,\" she assured Mr. Black.\n\nWith her second guest taken care of, she went back to the first pink room and lay down in her pink bed. She was just drifting off to sleep when she heard yet another knock at the front door. Completely perplexed, she left her pink room, walked down the pink hallway, down the pink staircase, to the pink front door and turned the pink doorknob. When she opened the pink front door she was Delighted to see her old friend Mr. Blue!\n\n\"I hope you don't mind housing and old goon like me, but my automobile has quit and I am without a place to lay my head, would you be so kind as to let me spend the night here?\" Said Mr. Blue.\n\n\"Why of course!\" Said Mrs. Pink.\n\nSo she lead him through the pink front door, up the pink staircase, down the pink hallway and to the fourth pink door on the right. She turned the pink doorknob on the pink door and let him into the pink bedroom.\n\n\"I'm sure this'll do for the time being,\" said Mrs. Pink.\nWith her third guest taken care of, she went back to the first pink room and lay down in her pink bed. Finally she was able to sleep soundly. The next morning, Mrs. Pink and her three guests made their ways out of their pink rooms, through the pink hallway, down the pink staircase and into the pink kitchen where they sat in pink chairs at the pink table.\n\n\"What would everybody like for breakfast?\" Inquired Mrs. Pink.\n\n\"I'd do mighty fine with a bowl of Lucky Charms,\" said Mr. Green.\n\nSo Mrs. Pink walked across her pink kitchen, reached in the pink cupboard and grabbed a pink bowl. She walked back across the pink kitchen and to the pink table where she poured a bowl of Lucky Charms for Mr. Green.\n\n\"I think a nice bowl of Wheaties would be good for me,\" said Mr. Black.\n\nSo Mrs. Pink strolled across her pink kitchen once again, reached in the pink cupboard and grabbed a pink bowl. She walked back across the pink kitchen and to the pink table where she poured a bowl of Wheaties for Mr. Black.\n\n\"I too would like some Lucky Charms,\" said Mr. Blue.\n\nSo Mrs. Pink walked across her pink kitchen, reached in the pink cupboard and grabbed another pink bowl. She walked back across the pink kitchen and to the pink table where she poured a bowl of Lucky Charms for Mr. Blue.\n\nAnd the moral of the story is that two out of three people prefer Lucky Charms to Wheaties.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Mrs. Pink", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_yzvzn", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yzvzn/mrs_pink/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "yzvzn", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Oxyquatzal", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yzvzn/mrs_pink/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1346234193.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/yzvzn/mrs_pink/", "created_utc": 1346205393.0, "ups": 21, "num_comments": 7}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>..and as they&#39;re taking off, the pilot says over the intercom &quot;folks, I have something to tell you.
