After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km&#39;s from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.</p>\n\n<p>Many years passed by like that.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.</p>\n\n<p>With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:</p>\n\n<p>- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:</p>\n\n<p>- Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.</p>\n\n<p>A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:</p>\n\n<p>- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger&#39;s hand and immediately he asked:</p>\n\n<p>- Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn&#39;t in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn&#39;t even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:</p>\n\n<p>- Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.</p>\n\n<p>- Don&#39;t mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn&#39;t follow because he couldn&#39;t swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km&#39;s away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:</p>\n\n<p>- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:</p>\n\n<p>- Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn&#39;t care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.</p>\n\n<p>- Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:</p>\n\n<p>- Son, why do you need it for God&#39;s sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village&#39;s locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.</p>\n\n<p>- Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!</p>\n\n<p>- There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger&#39;s arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:</p>\n\n<p>- But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest&#39;s hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest&#39;s face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest&#39;s fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:</p>\n\n<p>- Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I&#39;m very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?</p>\n\n<p>- All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.</p>\n\n<p>The priest was good, and never told anyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "**Edit**: Thank you for the gold, kind sir!\n\n**Note**: English is not my native language and I translated this from hungarian, so if something sounds funny, I am sorry for it.    \n  \n********    \n    \nThere was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath.

road in the scenic British countryside. He passes many beautiful houses, fields full of a variety of animals, trees and flowers. Being the nice day that it is, the man decides to explore more of the countryside, and finds himself in a very strange place. There are no cars, and no sign of houses, or any people to say the least.\nSuddenly, the car begins to stutter and shake. The engine begins to hum in an odd way, as if struggling to drive the car forward. Then the engine stopped with the sound of a clank. The man, although confused and a bit shocked, calmy reaches for his phone to call his roadside rescue. Being a British countryside, the man discovers his phone to read \n&quot;No service...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man, trying to be sensible decides to walk in hopes of finding someone who can help. \n&quot;A house&quot; he thinks to himself, &quot;I&#39;ll look for a house, someone can call a mechanic from their landline.&quot; The man begins to walk at a leisurely pace in hopes of finding a smidge of civilisation. He walks and walks for 20 minutes until he sees an old, but well looked-after house in the middle of nowhere. No chimney, no windows and no garden. The only thing the house had to show for itself was a dark brown wooden gate with fencing around the borders of the house.\n&quot;What an unusual house!&quot; The man said as he walked up to the big door. He knocks on the door and barely has any time to take his hand off the door before 3 monks, finely dressed greet him.\n&quot;Hello, Brother, how may we be of assistance to you?&quot; One of the monks asks before bowing politely and warmly.\n&quot;Hello, I&#39;m having a bit of trouble, my car has broken down and I need to call a mechanic, do you have a telephone I could borrow?&quot; The man replies\n&quot;My most sincere apologies, Brother, but we believe that telephones are a distraction from God&#39;s beautiful world, and as such do not possess a telephone.&quot;\nThe man starts to look disheveled. He looks at his watch at notices it is nearly 7pm. It begins to rain lightly before progressing into heaving rain. The rumbling of thunder can be heard in the background.\n&quot;Brother, it is getting late, may I suggest that you proceed on your journey tomorrow, and stay in our humble abode. Brother Eric here will prepare you a bed if you would like?&quot; The main monk suggests.\nThe man looks back at the abismal weather behind him and agrees gratefully\n&quot;My greatest of thanks, I very much appreciate it.&quot; He says.\nOne monk replies &quot;We are all God&#39;s creatures, Brother and we are taught to love thy neighbour. We will take you to the nearest village at 8am tomorrow, and there you will find a mechanic for your car.&quot;\nThe man smiles and has a relaxing evening before retiring to a cosy, warm bed. He falls asleep to the sound of Soothing Chanting and choir music.</p>\n\n<p>Later that night, the man wakes up to the sound of faint sounds in the distance. Being the curious man that he is, the man decides to get dressed, leave his room, go down stairs to where the sounds are louder. These sounds are the most beautiful sounds the man has ever heard. The man, although not religious, feels impeccably close to God. His heart starts racing and dazzling feelings of tranquility flow through him. The man begins to cry at the level of serenity he feels. This sound is beyond the supernatural and he walks closer and closer, listening to the source of the sound. He eventually isolates the sound to a door in the basement. The man is now crying heavily as the beautiful sounds kiss his ears.\nThen all of a sudden the sounds stop. The man, feeling tired decides to go back to bed in hopes that the sounds to start again. Having waited for two hours, the man falls asleep.\nAt breakfast the man is eating with the other monks and all of a sudden, a monk enters the room and says: &quot;Brother, we are ready to lead you to the village where you will find a mechanic.&quot; The man finishes his breakfast and walks out of the house and is given many handshakes  as all the monks say their goodbyes.</p>\n\n<p>The man and one of the monks walk for 40 minutes. They talk about the meaning of life, how the monks joined the brotherhood and why, until they cross a small village.\n&quot;You will find a mechanic in this building. I wish you well, Brother. You are most welcome to stay with us again. We don&#39;t get many visitors and greatly appreciate the company.&quot;\nAs the monk begins to turn away the man says &quot;Wait! I have to know about the sounds...I heard sounds. Beautiful sounds. Sounds I have never heard before. What were they? I must know&quot;\n&quot;Brother&quot; the monks replies, &quot;I cannot tell you, as you have to be a monk to know the source of the divine sounds.&quot;\nThe man, somewhat disappointed lets the monk on his way back and leads the mechanic by his pickup truck back to the broken down car at the side of the road.\n&quot;Oh, it was just the gasket there you see? It should be fine now&quot; the mechanic says. The engine starts perfectly.\nThe man drives home and tells his family of his travels, the monks and the divine sound like no other.</p>\n\n<p>2 years past since the day the man broke down and on his travels again, he decides to go back and greet the monks.\nAgain, he knocks on the door and is greeted by the welcoming and friendly monks who exclaim, &quot;Brother!

The man began to cry heavily at the warm feelings of serenity and peace. </p>\n\n<p>The man HAS to know what is making these sounds. The man wants to know what, or who could be making such beautiful sounds. The man knocks on the large wooden door.\nAll of a sudden, the sounds stop and 5 monks appear from behind it.\n&quot;Brother? Can we assist you in any way?&quot; One monk says.\nThe man, still dazzled by the sounds still ringing sweetly in his ears stutters &quot;The-the s-s-sounds...w-what were those beautiful, beautiful sounds? I must know.&quot;\nThe monks then look at each other until one of them says &quot;Brother, my apologies but you must be a monk to know the source of the sounds, you must become one of--&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;ll do whatever it takes.

It has taken many many years but the man, filling with excitement travels back to the house with no windows and no chimney, and tells the main monk he has competed his tasks.\n&quot;How many blades of grass are there?&quot;\nThe man takes a piece of paper out of his pocket and says \n&quot;377,832,728,191&quot;\n&quot;Correct, Brother, and how many grains of sand&quot;\n&quot;91,967,846,853,612&quot;\n&quot;Congratulations, Brother, you are now a monk.&quot;\n&quot;So can I know what the sounds are now?!&quot; The man exclaims in excitement.\n&quot;Meet us down at the door in the basement at midnight tonight&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man doesn&#39;t sleep that night. He stays awake in excitement knowing HE is finally going to know the source of those sounds, angelic and divine. The man is shaking in his new robes given to him by the monks. Then, the sounds starts, just as before, and the man begins to well up and cry in happiness. The clocks strikes 12. He remembers how the other monks had said &quot;you have to be a monk&quot; well now he WAS a monk, it was time for him to know the answer.\nThe man runs to the door he had once gone to and it greeted by three of the monks. &quot;Brother, in here you will discover the source of these beautiful sounds follow the door through.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The man opens the wooden door to reveal a bronze heavy door. The noises and sounds get slightly more audible and louder. \nThe man opens the bronze door to reveal a silver door.

I have counted every blade of grass and every grain of sand to know the source of this sound. It was worth every year of my life, and here I am!&quot;\nThe man, nervous, opens the door slowly, and indeed this is the source of the sound. The sounds intensify and bring the man to his knees in joy and tranquility. The man weeps in joy as he sees the source of the sound.\nDo you know what the sound was? Do you really want to know? The man has seen the source of the sound men cannot even dream of.\nSo you want to know the source?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sorry, you have to be a monk to know the source.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Warning: very very very long\nThis is a shaggy dog story.\n\n\nA man is on holiday, driving a car down a road in the scenic British countryside. He passes many beautiful houses, fields full of a variety of animals, trees and flowers. Being the nice day that it is, the man decides to explore more of the countryside, and finds himself in a very strange place. There are no cars, and no sign of houses, or any people to say the least.\nSuddenly, the car begins to stutter and shake. The engine begins to hum in an odd way, as if struggling to drive the car forward. Then the engine stopped with the sound of a clank. The man, although confused and a bit shocked, calmy reaches for his phone to call his roadside rescue. Being a British countryside, the man discovers his phone to read \n\"No service...\"\n\nThe man, trying to be sensible decides to walk in hopes of finding someone who can help. \n\"A house\" he thinks to himself, \"I'll look for a house, someone can call a mechanic from their landline.\" The man begins to walk at a leisurely pace in hopes of finding a smidge of civilisation. He walks and walks for 20 minutes until he sees an old, but well looked-after house in the middle of nowhere. No chimney, no windows and no garden. The only thing the house had to show for itself was a dark brown wooden gate with fencing around the borders of the house.\n\"What an unusual house!\" The man said as he walked up to the big door. He knocks on the door and barely has any time to take his hand off the door before 3 monks, finely dressed greet him.\n\"Hello, Brother, how may we be of assistance to you?\" One of the monks asks before bowing politely and warmly.\n\"Hello, I'm having a bit of trouble, my car has broken down and I need to call a mechanic, do you have a telephone I could borrow?\" The man replies\n\"My most sincere apologies, Brother, but we believe that telephones are a distraction from God's beautiful world, and as such do not possess a telephone.\"\nThe man starts to look disheveled. He looks at his watch at notices it is nearly 7pm. It begins to rain lightly before progressing into heaving rain. The rumbling of thunder can be heard in the background.\n\"Brother, it is getting late, may I suggest that you proceed on your journey tomorrow, and stay in our humble abode. Brother Eric here will prepare you a bed if you would like?\" The main monk suggests.\nThe man looks back at the abismal weather behind him and agrees gratefully\n\"My greatest of thanks, I very much appreciate it.\" He says.\nOne monk replies \"We are all God's creatures, Brother and we are taught to love thy neighbour.
