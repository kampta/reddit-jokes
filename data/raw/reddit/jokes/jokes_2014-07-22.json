Tasty stuff, although hot to the point of being painful, which comes with a written guarantee from me that if you eat it, the next day both of your butt cheeks WILL fall off.. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing. I had awakened that morning, and even after two cups of coffee (and all of you know what I mean) nothing happened. No &#39;Watson&#39;s Movement.

Upon entering the store at first all seemed normal. I selected a cart and began pushing it about dropping items in for purchase.. It wasn&#39;t until I was at the opposite end of the store from the toilets that the pain hit me. </p>\n\n<p>Oh, don&#39;t look at me like you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;m referring to that &#39;Uh, Oh, crap, gotta go&#39; pain that always seems to hit us at the wrong time. The thing is, this pain was different. The chillies from the night before were staging a revolt.  In a mad rush for freedom they bullied their way through the small intestines, forcing their way into the large intestines, and before I could take one step in the direction of the toilets which would bring sweet relief, it happened. The chillies fired a warning shot. </p>\n\n<p>There I stood, alone in the paint and stain section, suddenly enveloped in a toxic cloud the likes of which has never before been recorded. I was afraid to move for fear that more of this vile odor might escape me.  Slowly, oh so slowly, the pressure seemed to leave the lower part of my body, and I began to move up the aisle and out of it, just as a red aproned clerk turned the corner and asked if I needed any help. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what made me do it, but I stopped to see what his reaction would be to the toxic non-visible fog that refused to dissipate.. Have you ever been torn in two different directions emotionally? Here&#39;s what I mean, and I&#39;m sure some of you at least will be able to relate.  I could&#39;ve warned that poor clerk, but didn&#39;t.. I simply watched as he walked into an invisible, and apparently indestructible, wall of odor so terrible that all he could do before gathering his senses and running, was to stand there blinking and waving his arms about his head as though trying to ward off angry bees. This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh. .......BIG mistake!!!!! </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing. When you laugh, it&#39;s hard to keep things &#39;clamped down&#39;, if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.  Suddenly things were no longer funny.. &#39;It&#39; was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the toilet, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I&#39;d make it before the grand explosion took place. \n  Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable floating above the toilet seat because my butt is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of &#39;Shock and Awe&#39;.. He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, did it smell that bad when you ate it?&#39;, then quickly left. </p>\n\n<p>Once finished and I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, &#39;Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.&#39; </p>\n\n<p>My smirking of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, &#39;IT&#39;S YOU!&#39;, then ran off returning moments later with the manager. I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return. </p>\n\n<p>Home again without my supplies, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Lowes. I can&#39;t say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. They claim they&#39;re going to have to repaint the store.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "I went to Home Depot recently while not being altogether sure that course of action was a wise one.

This, of course, made me feel terrible, but then made me laugh. .......BIG mistake!!!!! \n\n\n Here's the thing. When you laugh, it's hard to keep things 'clamped down', if you know what I mean. With each new guffaw an explosive issue burst forth from my nether region. Some were so loud and echoing that I was later told a few folks in other aisles had ducked, fearing that someone was robbing the store and firing off a shotgun.  Suddenly things were no longer funny.. 'It' was coming, and I raced off through the store towards the toilet, laying down a cloud the whole way, praying that I'd make it before the grand explosion took place. \n  Luck was on my side. Just in the nick of time I got to the john, began the inevitable floating above the toilet seat because my butt is burning SO BAD, purging. One poor fellow walked in while I was in the middle of what is the true meaning of 'Shock and Awe'.. He made a gagging sound, and disgustedly said, did it smell that bad when you ate it?', then quickly left. \n\n\n  Once finished and I left the restroom, reacquired my partially filled cart intending to carry on with my shopping when a store employee approached me and said, 'Sir, you might want to step outside for a few minutes. It appears some prankster set off a stink bomb in the store. The manager is going to run the vent fans on high for a minute or two which ought to take care of the problem.' \n\n\n  My smirking of course set me off again, causing residual gases to escape me. The employee took one sniff, jumped back pulling his shirt up to cover his nose and, pointing at me in an accusing manner shouted, 'IT'S YOU!', then ran off returning moments later with the manager. I was unceremoniously escorted from the premises and asked none too kindly not to return. \n\n\n  Home again without my supplies, I realized that there was nothing to eat but leftover chili, so I consumed two more bowls. The next day I went to shop at Lowes. I can't say anymore about that because we are in court over the whole matter. They claim they're going to have to repaint the store.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title":

I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker. I began to think alone -- &quot;to relax,&quot; I told myself -- but I knew it wasn&#39;t true.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don&#39;t mix, but I couldn&#39;t stop myself.</p>\n\n<p>I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, &quot;What is it exactly we are doing here?&quot; I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, &quot;Man, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don&#39;t stop thinking on the job, you&#39;ll have to find other employment.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This gave me a lot to think about. I came home early after my conversation with the boss. &quot;Sweetheart,&quot; I confessed, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I know you have,&quot; she said, starting to cry, &quot;and if you don&#39;t stop, I&#39;ll want a divorce!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But dear, surely it&#39;s not that serious.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is serious,&quot; she said through her rolling tears. &quot;You think as much as college professors, and college professors don&#39;t make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won&#39;t have any money!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s a faulty syllogism,&quot; I said impatiently, and she began to cry again.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d had enough. &quot;I&#39;m going to the library,&quot; I snarled as I stomped out the door. I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with NPR on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors. They didn&#39;t open: the library was closed. To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?&quot; it asked.</p>\n\n<p>You probably recognize that line.

I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker. I began to think alone -- \"to relax,\" I told myself -- but I knew it wasn't true.\n\nThinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.\n\nI began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, \"What is it exactly we are doing here?\" I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, \"Man, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find other employment.\"\n\nThis gave me a lot to think about. I came home early after my conversation with the boss. \"Sweetheart,\" I confessed, \"I've been thinking...\"\n\n\"I know you have,\" she said, starting to cry, \"and if you don't stop, I'll want a divorce!\"\n\n\"But dear, surely it's not that serious.\"\n\n\"It is serious,\" she said through her rolling tears. \"You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!\"\n\n\"That's a faulty syllogism,\" I said impatiently, and she began to cry again.\n\nI'd had enough. \"I'm going to the library,\" I snarled as I stomped out the door. I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with NPR on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors. They didn't open: the library was closed. To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye.\n\n\"Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?\" it asked.\n\nYou probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.\n\nWhich is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a noneducational video; last week it was Porky's Revenge. Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting. I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home.\n\nLife just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.\n\nSoon, I will be able to vote Republican.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "My thinking problem.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2bc2mg", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bc2mg/my_thinking_problem/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2bc2mg", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ModerateBias", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bc2mg/my_thinking_problem/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1406007892.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2bc2mg/my_thinking_problem/", "created_utc": 1405979092.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A man goes to the doctor.
