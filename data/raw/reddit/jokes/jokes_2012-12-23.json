However, he comes to a pool and he realises he will have to swim underwater to get across. Not knowing how far it is he goes back to the monk who gives him an aqualung.\n\nAnd he goes back down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool and when he surfaces on the other side he is faced with a fourth door. So he goes back to the monk and gets the key to the fourth door.\n\nAnd he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool but he's forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to fourth door and he opens the fourth door and he finds himself in a pitch black room. He can tell this is where the noise is coming from but he can't see what it is so he goes back to the monk and gets a torch.\n\nAnd he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but he's forgotten the key to the second door so he gets the key to the second door and he opens the second door but he's forgotten the key to the third door so he gets the key to the third door and he opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool but he's forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to the fourth door and he opens the fourth door but he's forgotten the torch so he gets the torch and he goes into the room and flicks on the torch. But he doesn't see anything because the torch has no batteries. So he goes to the monk and he gets some batteries.\n\nAnd he goes down the corridor but he's forgotten the key to the first door so he gets the key to the first door and he opens the first door but

opens the third door but he's forgotten the aqualung so he gets the aqualung and he swims across the pool (having crossed the pool so many times he decides he probably didn't actually need the aqualung in the first place) but he's forgotten the key to the fourth door so he gets the key to the fourth door and he opens the fourth door but he's forgotten the torch so he gets the torch and he
