He stumbles upon an old cottage and thinks, maybe I may stay here for the night, as three days without rest, food, or drink, is a long time, and he was quite tired. So, he knocks on the knocker, and a short, dark old man, with a long white beard, answered. The wanderer says to him, \"I have been wandering, pondering, and rambling and ambling for three days and am quite tired. May I bunk here for the night?\" the man says, \"yes. But you mustn't ever have a thought of lust towards my daughter, or you will suffer the three worst Chinese tortures.\" the man agrees and comes in. He cleans up, and heads down for dinner. As he is sitting at the table, a young, busty, beautiful woman walks down the stairs. The man stares for so long, his eyes begin to water. After dinner, he couldn't help himself, and snuck to her room, and had the most enjoyment any man could have. He sneaks back to his room and falls asleep. The next morning, he wakes up to find a rock on his belly. A note on the rock reads, 'torture #1: uncomfortable rock on the abdomen'\nThe man thinks, 'the old man will have to do better than that', and throws the rock out the window. As he does this, he sees another note that reads, 'Chinese torture #2: rock tied to left testicle' the man panics, and jumps out the window after the rock. As he falls he sees the third and final note, which reads, much to his dismay, 'Chinese torture #3:right testicle tied to bed post\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [],
