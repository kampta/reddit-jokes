If they make any noise at all, they will be executed, but if they withstand it, they go free.\n\n\nFirst to return is Unidan, he is carrying a round, hard fruit that most people would not look twice at. Before he can explain what it is, the natives say: \"Ah yes, the [wood-apple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonia_acidissima) we make jam out of those. Bend over!\" As the fruit gets inserted unlubed and stem first, Unidan screams and gets his throat slit.\n\n\nSojoez figures that the natives have been living here for centuries and that the jungle knows no secrets to them, so he grabs 3 [cranberries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry) and returns to the village. The natives recognize the fruit and tell him to bend over. As the first two get inserted nothing happens, but at the third, Sojoez breaks into a laughing fit and also gets his throat slit.\n\n\nSomewhere in the afterlife, Unidan confronts Sojoez and asks: \"Why did you laugh? You where almost free to go.\"  \n\"I couldn't help it, I saw AWildSketchAppeared coming into the village carrying a watermelon!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A small plane crashes in the jungle...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_24kepi", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/24kepi/a_small_plane_crashes_in_the_jungle/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "24kepi", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sojoez", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/24kepi/a_small_plane_crashes_in_the_jungle/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1399088385.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/24kepi/a_small_plane_crashes_in_the_jungle/", "created_utc": 1399059585.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>An elderly man calls his doctor with a problem, &quot;Doc, I&#39;m having problems throughout the night.
