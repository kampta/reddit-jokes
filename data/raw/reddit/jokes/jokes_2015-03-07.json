The older brother had a cat, and what a beautiful cat it was! He loved his cat, absolutely adored it. So one day the older brother&#39;s boss told him that he had to go on an assignment to the capital city for the weekend. The older brother would have to give a presentation to some very important people in the company and if he went and did well, he would get a promotion, but if he didn&#39;t go, he would be fired.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the thing is, both of the brothers had spent their whole life in the village. They had never even been to the capital, but what choice did the brother have? He had to go or else he would be fired.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, on the Friday before he had to leave, he taught the younger brother how to look after the cat. He prepared a whole timetable for him!\nOn the next day, the brother left the house. He had a nice train journey to the capital and he enjoyed it very much. When he got to the hotel he decided to call his younger brother to check up on the cat. So this is how the conversation went:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Younger brother</strong>: &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Older brother</strong>: &quot;Hey, how are you? How&#39;s my cat doing?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Younger brother</strong>: &quot;Oh it died.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The older brother was devastated, especially because of the way that the younger brother delivered the bad news to him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Older brother</strong>: &quot;That&#39;s not the proper way to deliver bad news to someone!&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Younger brother</strong>: &quot;Oh. What should I have done?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Older brother</strong>: &quot;Well, for starters you have to drag it out. For example I&#39;d call you today and you&#39;d say: &quot;the cat is on the roof, I&#39;m trying to get it down now.&quot; Maybe half an hour later I&#39;d call you again and you would say: &quot;I couldn&#39;t get him down, so I called the fire brigade to come help.&quot; I might wait an hour and call you again and you would say: &quot;Oh yes, they are here and are climbing the roof right now.&quot; Then you&#39;d call be back and say: &quot;The cat fell off and I&#39;m driving him to the vet right now.&quot; Then maybe the next morning I would call back to ask and you would tell me that my cat couldn&#39;t make it through the night. Understand?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Younger brother</strong>: &quot;Yes, you&#39;re right, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Older brother</strong>: &quot;So anyways, how&#39;s mum doing?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Younger brother</strong>: &quot;She&#39;s on the roof, I&#39;m trying to get her down&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Source: My chemistry teacher.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "So there were two brothers who lived in a little village with their parents. The older brother had a cat, and what a beautiful cat it was! He loved his cat, absolutely adored it. So one day the older brother's boss told him that he had to go on an assignment to the capital city for the weekend. The older brother would have to give a presentation to some very important people in the company and if he went and did well, he would get a promotion, but if he didn't go, he would be fired.\n\nNow, the thing is, both of the brothers had spent their whole life in the village. They had never even been to the capital, but what choice did the brother have? He had to go or else he would be fired.\n\nSo anyway, on the Friday before he had to leave, he taught the younger brother how to look after the cat. He prepared a whole timetable for him!\nOn the next day, the brother left the house. He had a nice train journey to the capital and he enjoyed it very much. When he got to the hotel he decided to call his younger brother to check up on the cat. So this is how the conversation went:\n\n>   **Younger brother**: \"Hello?\"\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"Hey, how are you? How's my cat doing?\"\n>  \n>  **Younger brother**: \"Oh it died.\"\n>  \n>  The older brother was devastated, especially because of the way that the younger brother delivered the bad news to him.\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"That's not the proper way to deliver bad news to someone!\"\n>  \n>  **Younger brother**: \"Oh. What should I have done?\"\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"Well, for starters you have to drag it out. For example I'd call you today and you'd say: \"the cat is on the roof, I'm trying to get it down now.\" Maybe half an hour later I'd call you again and you would say: \"I couldn't get him down, so I called the fire brigade to come help.\" I might wait an hour and call you again and you would say: \"Oh yes, they are here and are climbing the roof right now.\" Then you'd call be back and say: \"The cat fell off and I'm driving him to the vet right now.\" Then maybe the next morning I would call back to ask and you would tell me that my cat couldn't make it through the night. Understand?\"\n>  \n>  **Younger brother**: \"Yes, you're right, I'm sorry.\"\n>  \n>  **Older brother**: \"So anyways, how's mum doing?\"\n> \n> **Younger brother**: \"She's on the roof, I'm trying
