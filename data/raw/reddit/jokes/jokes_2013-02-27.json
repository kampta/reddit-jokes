The guy in the car says no, so the guy on the bike drives off.\n\nHe comes to a second car and again pulls up next to it and taps on the window. When the driver rolls the window down, he asks the same question, \"Have you ever ridden a Harley?\" The lady in the car gives him a strange look and answers that she hadn't. Again, the rider pulls away without another word.\n\nThe rider sees a third car and speeds up to reach the car. Just as he's about to pull alongside, the road curves unexpectedly, and the guy on the bike careens off the road and into a ditch. The driver if the third car sees the whole scene and quickly stops to help. As he rushes to the man, he sees that he has been badly injured and is in need of immediate medical help. He asks the man if he is alright, and the man weakly asks the same question \"have you...ever ridden...a...Harley?\" Stunned, the man replies that he had. \n\nThe rider replies, \"where's the damn brake?\"\n\n(as told to me by my father tonight)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A guy buys an old Harley...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_19b2nu", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19b2nu/a_guy_buys_an_old_harley/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "19b2nu", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bmprigge", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19b2nu/a_guy_buys_an_old_harley/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1361967060.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19b2nu/a_guy_buys_an_old_harley/", "created_utc": 1361938260.0, "ups": 26, "num_comments": 2}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Actually, there is a vas deferens between the two genders.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Actually, there is a vas deferens between the two genders.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What's the difference between men and women?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_19b1hp", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19b1hp/whats_the_difference_between_men_and_women/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "19b1hp", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jerog1", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19b1hp/whats_the_difference_between_men_and_women/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1361966120.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19b1hp/whats_the_difference_between_men_and_women/", "created_utc": 1361937320.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A woman takes her pet duck to the vet, he&#39;s really limp and not active and she&#39;s extremely worried.

The chief, wary of letting a white man into his clan, devises a series of impossible challenges. He says, \"If you truly want to become part of our Eskimo family, you must do three things:\n1) You must drink one gallon of 151 rum, and if you can handle it and maintain all of your faculties, we will know your body and spirit are in harmony.\n2) You must climb up the tall mountain and kill the polar bear that resides in the cave at the summit.\n3) To show your true love for our race, you must make love to an Eskimo woman of my choosing.\"\n\nThe man thinks for a while, and agrees to complete the challenges.  He first drinks the gallon of 151 and it was like nothing ever happened to him. He can talk, walk, and think logically.  Next, he ascends the mountain and is not seen for a few hours after entering the cave. The chief breathes a sigh of relief, because he is sure the polar bear killed him, but gets the shock of his life when he sees the man descending the mountain. He is in tatters. His clothes are ripped, he is breathing heavily and sweating profusely, and his hair is pointing in every direction. \nHe approaches the chief, ready for the third challenge and asks, \"Alright, now who is this woman you want me to kill?\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A man wants to be an Eskimo...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_19abj6", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19abj6/a_man_wants_to_be_an_eskimo/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "19abj6", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "balzac453", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 127, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1361928427.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19abj6/a_man_wants_to_be_an_eskimo/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1361946154.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/19abj6/a_man_wants_to_be_an_eskimo/", "created_utc": 1361917354.0, "ups": 127, "num_comments": 16}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Lawyers should never ask grandmas a question if they aren\u2019t prepared for the answer!</p>\n\n<p>In a trial, a small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, an elderly grandmother to the stand.    </p>\n\n<p>He approached her and asked; &quot;Mrs. Jones, do you know me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She responded, &quot;Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams.
