At the end, he asks her to pull her pants down, turn around, and grab her ankles. Perplexed but desperate, she obliges.\n\n\"Ahh,\" says the doctor, \"it's as I thought. You have Zachary Riker disease. Very rare.\"\n\n\"Zachary Riker disease? What is it?\"\n\nThe doctor explains that he's not comfortable explaining the disease to her, as he is no expert. In fact, it's so rare, he doesn't even know of a doctor to whom he can refer the poor woman.\n\nNonplussed but determined to discover the cause behind her virginity, the woman leaves. She looks up another doctor, visits their office, and goes through the same spiel. Same thing: physical, pants down, grab your ankles, Zachary Riker. Even more surprising, the doctor gives the same excuse and refuses to elaborate. She leaves, finds another doctor.
