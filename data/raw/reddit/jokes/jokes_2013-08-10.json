The judge asks why he killed her. The man says \"I didn't kill her. She died because she ate a poisonous apple.\" \"Then why are her eyes black?\" asks the judge. \"She said she won't eat it.\"\n\n***\n\nAnother man is accused of killing his friend by stabbing him 48 times. In court the judge asks why he killed his friend. The man says \"I did not kill him Your Honor. I was peeling potatoes at home when my friend came to visit me. I dropped the knife when I tried to get up to greet him, but unfortunately he slipped and fell on the knife by his chest 48 times.\"\n\n***\n\nAn officer becomes a platoon leader. He lined up his troops and holding a paper with the names of the soldiers he called their names to see who is who. He calls \"John\" and a soldier goes \"Here!\". \"Smith\", \"Here!\". And as he progressed down the list calling their names one name came up. Not thinking much the officer calls \"Cat\" and a soldier goes \"Here!\". Funny name, he thinks to himself and sees the next name. Confused the officer calls \"Get your foot off the fence.\" and a soldier goes \"Here!\" After a few odd and strange names the officer says \"You people have some strange names.\" and a soldier goes \"Here!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Some translated jokes", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1k1j5j", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1k1j5j/some_translated_jokes/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1k1j5j", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drunkennova", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 34, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1k1j5j/some_translated_jokes/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1376102878.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1k1j5j/some_translated_jokes/", "created_utc": 1376074078.0, "ups": 34, "num_comments": 4}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>If I stand on stage, with four spotlights behind me, no matter how I tell the story, is everything I do going to be four - shadowed? </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "If I stand on stage, with four spotlights behind me, no matter how I tell the story, is everything I do going to be four - shadowed?
