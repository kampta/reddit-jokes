The doctor gave him 1 pill of mild laxative and told him that the chief should be fine tomorrow.\nThe warrior went back to the chief and gave him the pill. The next morning the warrior was sent back to the witch doctor and says &quot;Big chief, he no shit&quot;. The doctor gives him five pills of a stronger laxative to be given the chief. The next day the warrior appears at the doctor&#39;s house yet again saying &quot;big chief, he no shit&quot;. the doctor gets exasperated and so gives the warrior a whole bottle of the strongest laxative he has got.  The next day the warrior goes back to the doctor weeping. &quot;Big shit, no chief&quot;, he screamed to the doctor.</p>\n\n<p>A man goes to his doctor and says, &quot;I don&#39;t think my wife&#39;s hearing isn&#39;t as good as it used to be.

After dinner, the male asks the woman if she wants to go up to his hotel room.\n&#39;&#39;Sure,&#39;&#39; the woman says. &#39;&#39;Let me go wash my hands first.&#39;&#39; After she washes her hands, they have sex. After they are finished, she washes her hands again. This is really starting to annoy the male doctor so he says, &#39;&#39;You know, you must be a surgeon, because you keep washing your hands.&#39;&#39; Angry at this remark, the woman says, &#39;&#39;Well, you must be an anasthesiologist, because I didn&#39;t feel a thing!&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Q: Why did the doctor put condoms on his ears during sex?\nA: He didn&#39;t want to get hearing aids. </p>\n\n<p>Q: How do you know that carrots are good for your eyesight?\nA: Have you ever seen a rabbit with glasses? </p>\n\n<p>An old woman walked into a dentist&#39;s office, took off all her clothes and spread her legs.

She called his name, but he didn&#39;t get up. So she took him to the vet and told the vet that her dog wouldn&#39;t wake up. So he looked at her dog and said, &#39;&#39;Your dog is dead&#39;&#39;. She asked the doctor to perform another test to be sure.</p>\n\n<p>The doctor went into another room, and came back with a cage. In it there was a cat. He let the cat out, and she walked arund the dog, sniffed, and went back in her cage. The doc put the cat back in the other room. He came out and said again, &#39;&#39;Your dog is dead&#39;&#39;.\nShe said,&#39;&#39;Ok, how much do I owe you?&#39;&#39;\nThe doctor said, &#39;&#39;$300&#39;&#39;\nShe said, &#39;&#39;What!

His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>[A COMPUTER DIAGNOSIS]\n&#39;&#39;Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.&quot; Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: &quot;You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.&quot; Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: &quot;Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren&#39;t yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don&#39;t stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A man working with an electric saw accidentally cuts off all of his fingers.

Their doctor tells them that many people find it useful to write themselves little notes.</p>\n\n<p>When they get home, the wife says, &quot;Dear, will you please go to the kitchen and get me a dish of ice cream? And maybe write that down so you won&#39;t forget?&quot; \n&quot;Nonsense,&quot; says the husband. &quot;I can remember a dish of ice cream.&quot; &quot;Well, I&#39;d also like some strawberries and whipped cream on it,&quot; the wife replies.\n&quot;My memory&#39;s not all that bad,&quot; says the husband. &quot;No problem -- a dish of ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream. I don&#39;t need to write it down.&quot;\nHe goes into the kitchen, and his wife hears pots and pans banging.\nThe husband finally emerges from the kitchen and presents his wife with a plate of bacon and eggs.\nShe looks at the plate and asks, &quot;Hey, where&#39;s the toast I asked for?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>[THE FRIDGE]\nBertha was worried about her husband George, so one day she took him to the doctor&#39;s.

They had been friends in school but had lost touch over time. They used sign language to catch up on old times. Through the course of conversation one of the deaf-mutes learned the other had learned to speak and was no longer mute. This amazed the fellow that was still mute and he asked about the procedure. His friend gave him the doctor&#39;s card and went on his way. The deaf mute wasted no time and went straight to the doctor&#39;s office. The doctor informed the procedure took 26 days and cost one million dollars. The man handed the doc his insurance card and begged the doctor to start the treatment that day. The doctor had the man strip and lay over the examination table. The doctor went to his closet and took out a bucket of mayonnaise and a broom handle with a door knob on the end. The doc got a running start and shoved the mayonaise covered door knob up the deaf-mute&#39;s ass. The mute screamed,&quot;AY!AY!AY!&quot; The doctor said,&quot;very good we will work on the B&#39;s tomorrow.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Doctor, doctor!

So after about half a painful hour of abortive attempts to get it on, an idea occurs to the husband. &#39;&#39;OK, honey,&#39;&#39; he says, &#39;&#39;this is what we&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll go into the closet and you go into the bathroom. We&#39;ll both get undressed and turn off the lights in the bedroom. And then on the count of three we&#39;ll both rush out at each other and then it will just happen in the middle of the bedroom.&#39;&#39; The wife is a bit unsure about this, but since she doesn&#39;t have any better ideas she agrees.\nSo, the husband goes into the closet and the wife goes into the bathroom and they both get undressed. The anticipation is driving the husband mad and as he takes off his clothes he gets an enormous erection. The wife turns off the lights and on the count of three they both rush into the bedroom towards each other. But since the room is dark the husband gets disoriented and runs by his wife \u2014 right into the dresser. He hits the dresser so hard that he passes out from the pain.\nThe next thing he remembers is coming to in a hosital bed, with a doctor looking down at him. His throbbing dick is still so painful that he moans to the doctor, &#39;&#39;Doc, doc, how bad is it?&#39;&#39;\n&#39;&#39;That&#39;s nothing, son. Wait till you see your wife! We still haven&#39;t gotten her off the doorknob.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>[Hillbilly Newlyweds]\nA newly married hillbilly couple decided they wanted children, but didn&#39;t know how to go about it. Questions and conversations with friends and relatives proved no help, until a neighbor said they should go to town and ask the Big City Doctor. The doctor let them look at a child&#39;s book about where babies came from, but to no avail. He tried his own explanation but was met with blank stares. Exasperated, he took them to his private office, and showed them a porno movie. This was also useless. Angrily, he ordered the girl to strip, told the man to watch, and had sex with her on the couch.\n&#39;&#39;Now, do you understand?&#39;&#39; he asked.\n&#39;&#39;I just have one question.

Look around and say, &#39;Now where am I gonna hide my panties?&#39; Don&#39;t you roll them up and stick them in your purse? Or you tuck them down in your shoe?

So the first man steps up to recount his story. \"Well you see, I got off early from work and decided to surprise my wife with wine and flowers. I entered our bedroom only to discover my wife naked, alone and panting. Now of coarse I assumed the worst and tore apart the whole house looking for her lover. After not finding anyone I made my way back to the bedroom to apologize. Seconds after I walked back in, a pair of hands hanging off the balcony catch my eye. Furious, I ran into the study, grabbed a hammer and went to town bagging that bastards fingers until he fell. Thinking a fall from a second floor balcony wasn't enough to kill him, I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the refrigerator and shoved it over the balcony. In all the rage and anger I wound up having a heart attack.\" Seeing as his story involved murder. He was sent to hell. The second guy steps and to recount his story. \"I was fixing a sliding glass door for a customer. Yanking at some stubborn nails, I lost my balence from a third floor balcony I was on and fell ove the rail. Luckily I was able to catch the rail below.
