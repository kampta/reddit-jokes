I was crushed to death in the most gruesome manner imaginable.\"\n\n\nSt. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really start to enjoy this job.\n\n\n\"Tell me about the day you died?\", he said to the third man in line.\n\n\n\"OK, picture this, I'm naked, hiding inside a refrigerator...\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Overcrowding in Heaven...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_107w9i", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/107w9i/overcrowding_in_heaven/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "107w9i", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kalphak", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/107w9i/overcrowding_in_heaven/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1348211523.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/107w9i/overcrowding_in_heaven/", "created_utc": 1348182723.0, "ups": 6, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s the first day for a fraternity, and the dean is explaining the rules to the new pledges.
