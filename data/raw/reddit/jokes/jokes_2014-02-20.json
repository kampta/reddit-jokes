Sally is devastated that she is being picked on by Johnny and she runs home, crying.\n\nThe next day, Sally and Johnny are again playing in the sandbox and Johnny decides it's time to once again see if he can get Sally riled up, so he starts the game again by whipping up his shirt.\n\n\"I have one of THESE and I have one of THESE!!\"\n\nSally follows suit, pulls up her shirt and responds \"Yup, I have one of THESE and I have one of THESE, too\".\n\nJohnny, sensing victory is near, excitedly whips down his pants and shouts \"Well I have one of THESE..and YOU DON\"T!!\" And Johnny laughs and laughs. He starts similar taunting to the day before.\n\nSally waits for Johnny, but does not cry or run away this time. When Johnny calms down a bit, only then does Sally pull down her pants and says: \n\n\"Well, Johnny, I have one of THESE...and my mommy says that with one of THESE, I can get as many of THOSE as I want\".\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Sally's Mommy is smart (marginally NSFW)", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": true, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1ycvk2", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ycvk2/sallys_mommy_is_smart_marginally_nsfw/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1ycvk2", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thedavemcsteve", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ycvk2/sallys_mommy_is_smart_marginally_nsfw/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1392859226.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ycvk2/sallys_mommy_is_smart_marginally_nsfw/", "created_utc": 1392830426.0, "ups": 16, "num_comments": 2}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>At the pearly gates, St Peter asks the first one: </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What did you do on Earth, son?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I was a lawyer for public interest, i helped people keep their jobs&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come in, son!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And you?&quot; to the second guy.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I was a doctor, i helped people be healthy&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Please come in, son&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Third guy answers: &quot;I was a musician&quot;</p>\n\n<p>St Peter: &quot;Oh, there&#39;s a door in the back&quot; </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "At the pearly gates, St Peter asks the first one: \n\n\"What did you do on Earth, son?\"\n\nI was a lawyer for public interest, i helped people keep their jobs\"\n\n\"Come in, son!\"\n\n\"And you?\" to the second guy.\n\n\"I was a doctor, i helped people be healthy\"\n\n\"Please come in, son\"\n\nThird guy answers: \"I was a musician\"\n\nSt Peter: \"Oh, there's a door in the back\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Three guys go to Heaven.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1ycuug", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ycuug/three_guys_go_to_heaven/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1ycuug", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "onairmastering", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ycuug/three_guys_go_to_heaven/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1392858859.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1ycuug/three_guys_go_to_heaven/", "created_utc": 1392830059.0, "ups": 21, "num_comments": 4}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>a lady from Birmingham stood up and said,</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ladies, last year I vowed to no longer cook for my husband.
