When he left the hospital his mind was at long last clear, but naturally he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.\n\nAs he walked down the street, he walked past a men's clothing store and thought buying a new suit might cheer him up. The salesman eyed him briefly and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see... size 44 long.\u201d Joe laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, how did you know?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d said the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, and it fit perfectly.\n\nAs Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, \u201cHow about a new shirt?\u201d Joe thought for a moment and then said, \u201cSure...\u201d The salesman eyed Joe and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see ... 34 sleeve and ... 16 neck.\u201d Joe was once again surprised, \u201cThat\u201ds exactly right. How did you know?\" \u201cIt\u201ds my job,\u201d said the salesman. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.\n\nAs Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, \u201cHow about new shoes?\u201d Joe was on a roll by this point and said, \u201cWell, sure ....\u201d The salesman eyed Joe\u2019s feet and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see...9...wide.\u201d Joe was astonished, \u201cThat\u2019s right .... How did you know?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d said the salesman. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly.\n\nJoe was feeling great when the salesman asked, \u201cHow about some new underwear?\u201d Joe hesitated for a second and said, \u201cSure...\u201d The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe\u2019s waist and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see...size large.\u201d Joe laughed, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve worn size medium since I was 18 years old.\u201d\n\nThe salesman shook his head, \u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly, you can\u2019t wear a medium.
