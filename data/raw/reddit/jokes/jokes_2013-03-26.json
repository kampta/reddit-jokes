Unable to leave the confessional unattended, he calls over the church's janitor.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but would you mind covering my post for a short bit? It's the easiest thing in the world, all you need to do is sit here, and if anyone comes in, just consult this guide-book: it has every possible sin in it and what you should say in response.\"\n\nThe janitor agrees and the priest heads off to the bathroom, wouldn't you know it, as soon as he leaves, a teenage girl comes in to confess. With no other choice, the janitor tries as best as he can.\n\n\"Tell me your sins, child.\"\n\n\"Well Father, me and my boyfriend...  the other day... we kissed.\"\n\nThe janitor flips through the book, finds kissing. \"say one hail mary and don't do it again.\"\n\n\"The thing is Father... we actually did a bit more than that... we had sex.\"\n\nThe janitor flips through the book, finds premarital sex. \"say two hail mary's and don't do it again.\n\n\"well... in all honesty, Father... my boyfriend is a bit kinky... and we actually did anal...\"\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" thinks the janitor. He flips through the book, but as hard as he looks, he can't find the entry for anal sex, it is simply not in the guidebook.\n\nNow the janitor is starting to freak, worried both he and the priest will be found out, and that he could loose his job. Quickly, he peaks outside the confessional door and spots an altar boy walking by.\n\n\"psssst.\" hisses the janitor, calling the alter boy over, \"quick, what does Father O'Thomas give for anal?\"\n\nThe alter boy thinks for a moment then replies...\n\n\"Two Butterfingers and a ride home?\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A Priest is working in a confessional...

The morning of Pope Francis&#39; arrival he went down to the docks and found a young member of his congregation and said, &quot;I would like to help honor the new pope by contributing to the feast tonight. Would you help me catch a fish for the meal?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;d be glad to help!&quot; said the young man.</p>\n\n<p>About an hour later and with the young man&#39;s help Father O&#39;Leary finally got a fish on the line. As he was no fisherman he nearly lost it but with the boy&#39;s assistance the rather large fish was reeled in.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Wow!&quot; exclaimed the young man. &quot;I thought we&#39;d lost him there for a second! Just look at it-- that is one huge son of a bitch!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Father O&#39;Leary&#39;s smile from his success turned into a frown. &quot;Young man,&quot; he said, &quot;you forget yourself. I am a man of the cloth. You should not use such foul language around me.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The young fisherman, thinking quickly, said, &quot;No, no! You don&#39;t understand. That fish right there? It&#39;s a <em>sonofabitch</em>. Very common in these waters, you see, but this one is particularly large!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>O&#39;Leary looked at the flopping fish for a moment, considered, and then nodded. &quot;Well... if that&#39;s its name then that&#39;s its name. And you&#39;re right, he is rather large! God has blessed us with a wonderful meal to serve our new pope.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When Father O&#39;Leary returned to his church he discovered that Bishop Conner had arrived during his absence. He explained to the bishop his plan for serving the new pope a special dinner that night.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A most wonderful idea!&quot; said Bishop Conner. &quot;If only I could also contribute somehow...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said O&#39;Leary, &quot;I was going to do it myself but if you&#39;d like you may gut and clean the fish. I would warn warn you, though, that it is one very large <em>sonofabitch</em>.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The bishop&#39;s cheerful smile disappeared. &quot;Father!&quot; he scolded. &quot;Have you forgotten yourself!? How dare you use such language in a house of God!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No, no, you don&#39;t understand,&quot; pleaded the priest. &quot;That&#39;s the fish I caught, a <em>sonofabitch</em>. The young man who helped me catch it said that they are plentiful in these waters but that this is one of the largest he&#39;s ever seen!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; nodded the bishop. &quot;Well then, I wouldn&#39;t mind cleaning the sonofabitch for his Holiness!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>After gutting and cleaning the fish Bishop Conner brought it to the Mother Superior. &quot;Pope Francis will arrive for dinner soon,&quot; he told the elderly woman. &quot;Please take special care preparing this meal. I have personally gutted and cleaned the <em>sonofabitch</em> but as you can see, this <em>sonofabitch</em> is very large.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The mother superior&#39;s face drained of color and her eyes went wide at the Bishops words. &quot;Wh-- wha--?&quot; she stammered while clutching her rosaries. </p>\n\n<p>Bishop Conner, realizing his mistake, quickly said, &quot;No, no, I know what you&#39;re thinking, Mother. Worry not, I have not profaned: this fish is what&#39;s known as a <em>sonofabitch</em>.

The morning of Pope Francis' arrival he went down to the docks and found a young member of his congregation and said, \"I would like to help honor the new pope by contributing to the feast tonight. Would you help me catch a fish for the meal?\"\n\n\"I'd be glad to help!\" said the young man.\n\nAbout an hour later and with the young man's help Father O'Leary finally got a fish on the line. As he was no fisherman he nearly lost it but with the boy's assistance the rather large fish was reeled in.\n\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed the young man. \"I thought we'd lost him there for a second! Just look at it-- that is one huge son of a bitch!\"\n\nFather O'Leary's smile from his success turned into a frown. \"Young man,\" he said, \"you forget yourself. I am a man of the cloth. You should not use such foul language around me.\"\n\nThe young fisherman, thinking quickly, said, \"No, no! You don't understand. That fish right there? It's a *sonofabitch*. Very common in these waters, you see, but this one is particularly large!\"\n\nO'Leary looked at the flopping fish for a moment, considered, and then nodded. \"Well... if that's its name then that's its name. And you're right, he is rather large! God has blessed us with a wonderful meal to serve our new pope.\"\n\nWhen Father O'Leary returned to his church he discovered that Bishop Conner had arrived during his absence. He explained to the bishop his plan for serving the new pope a special dinner that night.\n\n\"A most wonderful idea!\" said Bishop Conner. \"If only I could also contribute somehow...\"\n\n\"Well,\" said O'Leary, \"I was going to do it myself but if you'd like you may gut and clean the fish. I would warn warn you, though, that it is one very large *sonofabitch*.\"\n\nThe bishop's cheerful smile disappeared. \"Father!\" he scolded. \"Have you forgotten yourself!? How dare you use such language in a house of God!\"\n\n\"No, no, you don't understand,\" pleaded the priest. \"That's the fish I caught, a *sonofabitch*. The young man who helped me catch it said that they are plentiful in these waters but that this is one of the largest he's ever seen!\"\n\n\"Ah, I see,\" nodded the bishop. \"Well then, I wouldn't mind cleaning the sonofabitch for his Holiness!\"\n\nAfter gutting and cleaning the fish Bishop Conner brought it to the Mother Superior. \"Pope Francis will arrive for dinner soon,\" he told the elderly woman. \"Please take special care preparing this meal. I have personally gutted and cleaned the *sonofabitch* but as you can see, this *sonofabitch* is very large.\"\n\nThe mother superior's face drained of color and her eyes went wide at the Bishops words. \"Wh-- wha--?\" she stammered while clutching her rosaries. \n\nBishop Conner, realizing his mistake, quickly said, \"No, no, I know what you're thinking, Mother.
