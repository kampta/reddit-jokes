How about you go practice on that today, and come back in tomorrow - then you can see what a real woman feels like!\" The chief thought about this and said \"OK me go practice then come tomorrow for white woman.\" ------  Fast forward to the next day and the chief walks in demanding his woman. \"OK chief I saw you out there practicing. I think you are ready, go down the hall third room on your right. there will be a white woman in there for you.\" and the chief goes to his white woman. Three minutes later the lady at the front desk hears HORRENDOUS screaming from the room the Chief had gone into - she runs down the hall and bursts into the room, only to find Chief Bowels RAMMING A BROOM STICK IN THE HOOKERS PUSSY! \"What in the HELL are you doing!\" She screams... The chief calmly looks at her and mutters the words \"checking for bees.\"  ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true,
