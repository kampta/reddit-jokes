He began walking slowly, then burst into a sprint, jumped, and smacked his forehead on the edge of the bell.</p>\n\n<p>BWOOOOOOOOONNNG</p>\n\n<p>The minister couldn&#39;t believe it.

Although his previous thoughts about brain damage were almost certainly proven, he simply could not believe how beautiful the sound was that the bell made.

The minister then made the final decision to make this young man the next bell ringer.</p>\n\n<p>A few days had passed, and it was time for the funeral for the former ringer.
