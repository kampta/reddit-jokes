Around noon, a Trucker rolled up, stopping beside the field the farmer was working that day. &quot;Hey farmer, that&#39;s some mighty fine honeysuckle you have there. Mind if I grab myself some jars of honey?&quot; The Farmer, thinking the Trucker a fool, waved him on. &quot;Sure, you go right ahead.&quot; Sure enough, an hour later the Trucker came back with jars filled to the brim with honey! The Trucker left, leaving the Farmer astounded there in his fields. The next day, just like before, the Trucker rolled up again at noon. &quot;Hey Farmer, thanks again for the honey.

states the Republican senator, &quot;H-E-double hockey sticks is nothing like I thought it was going to be.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And it&#39;s so weird that you&#39;re the devil,&quot; he continues, &quot;and that you seem so much smarter down here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Always the one you least suspect, eh?&quot; the devil asks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, actually...&quot; the senator mutters but is cut off by the devil.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s time for your day in Heaven, though,&quot; notes the devil, pulling a lever.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the Republican is on an escalator, but going up.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh, fudgesicles,&quot;

the Republican mutters to self.</p>\n\n<p>Just then, he notices that he&#39;s being met by six females who each look about twenty-one, with gorgeous faces and thick, wavy hair, flat stomachs, tight butts, and long, thin legs, clad in revealing lingerie and high heels.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What are these odd, sinful creatures?&quot; the Republican muttered. &quot;And why does one look like the players from that Negro League. Their kind isn&#39;t supposed to be allowed in...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>His musings were cut off by one of the girls, who said, &quot;Hi, I hear you&#39;re new here. We try to give everyone a nice welcome, so you get all six of us. You want to go upstairs?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why?&quot; the Republican asked. &quot;Is O&#39;Reilly playing on a TV there?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The girl giggled, then said, &quot;No, we were going to play.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Bingo?&quot; the Republican inquired, excited. &quot;Great, I&#39;m a master at G52!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; the girl responded, giggling again. &quot;we had something better in mind. Actually, you can have me first, all three ways.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; the Republican responded, confused, &quot;so we&#39;ll do regular Bingo, then corners, and postage stamp?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The girl, now very amused, contined, &quot;Actually, we can...&quot; then leaned over and whispered in his ear.</p>\n\n<p>The Republican yelped, and then ran into the bathroom, where he locked the door and crouched down by the toilet, in tears.</p>\n\n<p>After an hour, he managed to crawl up, where he saw some dispensers on the wall.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why, these are those sin balloons,&quot; he noted, before picking up a bottle next to the sink and wondering, &quot;and what is this odd, gooey substance?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, the night passed, and he heard a knocking on the door.\n&quot;Are you okay in there?&quot; called Peter. &quot;Because it&#39;s time for you to make your decision...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The Republican senator cautiously opened the door, and peered around to make sure the girls were gone.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve experienced a day in Heaven and a day in Hell,&quot; Peter noted. &quot;So where would you like to spend eternity?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this after all I&#39;d heard on Earth,&quot; the Republican replied, &quot;but I much preferred the other place... you know, H-E-double hockey sticks.

Their kind isn't supposed to be allowed in...\"\n\nHis musings were cut off by one of the girls, who said, \"Hi, I hear you're new here. We try to give everyone a nice welcome, so you get all six of us. You want to go upstairs?\"\n\n\"Why?\" the Republican asked. \"Is O'Reilly playing on a TV there?\"\n\nThe girl giggled, then said, \"No, we were going to play.\"\n\n\"Bingo?\" the Republican inquired, excited. \"Great, I'm a master at G52!\"\n\n\"No,\" the girl responded, giggling again. \"we had something better in mind. Actually, you can have me first, all three ways.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" the Republican responded, confused, \"so we'll do regular Bingo, then corners, and postage stamp?\"\n\nThe girl, now very amused, contined, \"Actually, we can...\" then leaned over and whispered in his ear.\n\nThe Republican yelped, and then ran into the bathroom, where he locked the door and crouched down by the toilet, in tears.\n\nAfter an hour, he managed to crawl up, where he saw some dispensers on the wall.\n\n\"Why, these are those sin balloons,\" he noted, before picking up a bottle next to the sink and wondering, \"and what is this odd, gooey substance?\"\n\nEventually, the night passed, and he heard a knocking on the door.\n\"Are you okay in there?\" called Peter. \"Because it's time for you to make your decision...\"\n\nThe Republican senator cautiously opened the door, and peered around to make sure the girls were gone.\n\n\"You've experienced a day in Heaven and a day in Hell,\" Peter noted. \"So where would you like to spend eternity?\"\n\n\"I can't believe I'm saying this after all I'd heard on Earth,\" the Republican replied, \"but I much preferred the other place... you know, H-E-double hockey sticks. I'd like to go there.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, Republican,\" Peter responds while reaching for a lever, \"go to Hell.\"\n\nBefore he knows it, the Republican senator is back on the escalator, heading down.\n\n\"Fine and dandy,\" notes the Republican as the double doors open.\n\nHe walks out and finds himself in a barren land, covered with garbage and with flames occasionally bursting from the ground.\n\nHis friends are in rags, picking up endless streams of trash and getting poked with pitchforks, as they move along a floor of hot coals.\n\nThe devil appears and the senator approaches him.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" cries the Republican. \"Yesterday I played golf and drank champagne.

This happens a few more times, each experiement ending in failure, with no further understanding of the relationship between the Bennies and their hair.  Soon, unable to take the grief, the scientists decide to halt the research into the Bennies' hair.  \n\n\n\nEventually, the director of the facility comes by the lab, and asks the chief scientist whether they would be continuing with the research into the cause of the overgrown body hair on the Bennies.  The scientist, outraged and in mourning, grasps a jar full of a Benny's ashes and answered,      \n\n\n\n\"No sir, I believe at this point it is clear that a Benny shaved is a Benny urned.\"  ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "title": "A clone experiment gone wrong.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_3ca2vm", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3ca2vm/a_clone_experiment_gone_wrong/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "3ca2vm", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LazyGene", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3ca2vm/a_clone_experiment_gone_wrong/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1436197469.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/3ca2vm/a_clone_experiment_gone_wrong/", "created_utc": 1436168669.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Worried about their less than exciting sex life, a young wife sends her husband to a therapist who winds up treating him with self-hypnosis.
