He even installed a small swinging door in Major\u2019s bachelor pad, leading into the female hens\u2019 area so that whenever the Major wants himself some Kentucky Vajajay he can just swing around and plants his seed while the hens were eating their seed..ha!\nBob thought, \u2018This is awesome, the Major will get poonany and I will get these awesome home grown eggs for my breakfast every day\u2019!\nAnyway, a few weeks go by with the Major causing havoc in the female population every day and night\u2026BUT\u2026there are no eggs!!

So what&#39;s your story?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The first man replies: &quot;Well, for a while I&#39;ve suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn&#39;t reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn&#39;t you know it, he wouldn&#39;t fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn&#39;t stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn&#39;t stand it any more, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge, and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,&quot; said Peter, and let the man in. </p>\n\n<p>The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn&#39;t hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I&#39;m here.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. </p>\n\n<p>The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated.

So what's your story?\"\n\nThe first man replies: \"Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it any more, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge, and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony.\" \n\n\"That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,\" said Peter, and let the man in. \n\nThe second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. \n\n\"It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here.\" \n\nOnce again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. \n\nThe third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. \n\n\"Picture this,\" says the third man, \"I'm hiding naked inside a refrigerator...\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Long Joke with a fridge in it", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2ksez5", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2ksez5/long_joke_with_a_fridge_in_it/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2ksez5", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zerocored", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2ksez5/long_joke_with_a_fridge_in_it/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1414711837.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2ksez5/long_joke_with_a_fridge_in_it/", "created_utc": 1414683037.0, "ups": 3, "num_comments": 2}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>They&#39;ll never be royals</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "They'll never be royals", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What's the similarity of the World Series and Lorde?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2kscbn", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2kscbn/whats_the_similarity_of_the_world_series_and_lorde/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2kscbn", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DustyJimster", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2kscbn/whats_the_similarity_of_the_world_series_and_lorde/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1414710352.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2kscbn/whats_the_similarity_of_the_world_series_and_lorde/", "created_utc": 1414681552.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A knob-hoggin&#39;

(Warning, very long)</p>\n\n<p>there was once a great photographer, who prided himself on taking a picture of every animal on earth, from the most common  bug, to the rarest fish . Well one day, at a big party celebrating the Photographer\u2019s 1,000,000th picture, an old man approached the photographer. \u201cSo\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve photographed every animal on earth have you?\u201d \u201cYep\u201d he said \u201cEvery one\u201d. the old man looked at him with doubt. \u201cHow about the Purple Gorilla\u201d he said. \u201cOf course\u201d, said the photographer. \u201cThe Red Gorilla\u201d asked the old man, \u201cone of my best\u201d said the photographer, with an air of smugness. The old man pondered for a moment \u201cWell, how about the Blue Gorilla\u201d Asked the old man. \u201cBlue Gorilla?\u201d said the photographer, \u201cTheres no such thing as a Blue Gorilla\u201d. \u201cOh yes there is\u201d said the old man \u201cHe lives on a golden throne, in the biggest room, in a huge diamond palace on top the highest mountain in the most dangerous jungle in all the Peru\u201d the old man said \u201cAnd every photographer who has ever gone looking for him, has never returned\u201d. The photographer thinks for a moment, \u201cTheres is certainly no such thing as a Blue Gorilla, is there?\u201d he thought \u201cBut if there is, then I MUST be the first to photograph it!\u201d So that very night, he bought his plane tickets to peru, and by morning, he was off.</p>\n\n<p>He landed at the airport in peru the next morning, and hailed a taxi. once he got in he said to the old taxi driver, \u201cTake me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d said the driver, \u201cI can\u2019t take you there, he\u2019ll rip off my arms and beat me with them! But i can take you to his jungle\u201d. so off they drove to the edge of the jungle. Once they got there the photographer was greeted by an old explorer, the photographer asked \u201cCan you take me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d says the explorer \u201cI can\u2019t take you there, he\u2019ll rip off my legs and force me to run on his treadmill! But i can take you to the base of his mountain. so they walked to the base of the mountain. Once they got there, the photographer was greeted by an old sherpa, the photographer asked \u201cCan you take me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d said the sherpa \u201cI can\u2019t take you to him, he\u2019ll rip off my head and make me play football with it, but I can take you up the mountain\u201d. so they climbed up the mountain. for three days they climbed up the mountain, then four, then five, the mountain got steeper 45, 60, 75, 90, 100 degree angles they climbed, until finally, they made it.</p>\n\n<p>It was just like the old man said, a giant palace made entirely of diamonds. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d said the photographer, as he approached the giant diamond door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive golden door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive steel door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive iron door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive golden room, and at the end of the room was a massive copper door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive stone door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive wooden door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive bead curtain. he pushed the curtain aside, and behind the curtain, was a big banquet hall, and at the end of the banquet hall, sitting on a massive throne, was a BIG, HARRY, BLUE GORILLA. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh my god\u201d the photographer said \u201cHe\u2019s real, there really is a Blue Gorilla!\u201d he took out his camera and started snapping pictures, hundreds of pictures. finally he ran out of film, and started packing his camera away, then he had a thought. \u201cHey\u201d he said \u201cThat Blue Gorilla hasn&#39;t moved the entire time i was here, he could be FAKE for all I know, I need to touch him just to be sure\u201d. So he carefully walked up to the throne, leaned over to the Blue Gorilla, reached out his hand, and gently poked his face. </p>\n\n<p>The Blue Gorilla sprang out of his throne and growled \u201cGRRRAWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla. The photographer screamed! \u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big wooden door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big stone door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big copper door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big iron door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big steel door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big golden door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big diamond door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRR AWWWW\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNO\u201d, said the photographer, \u201ci\u2019d rather jump off the mountain than be killed by the Blue Gorilla!\u201d so he jumped off the mountain. as he fell he said, \u201cFinally, i\u2019m safe\u201d then he looked up \u201cGRRRR AWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, as he plummeted after the photographer! the photographer landed safely in a haystack at the mountain\u2019s base, he ran and ran, the Blue Gorilla in hot pursuit. Then, in the distance, he saw the taxi driver at the edge of the jungle. \u201cHELP HELP!\u201d he said, \u201cTHE BLUE GORILLA IS CHASING ME\u201d he quickly jumped in the back of the taxi, and they sped off. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m finally safe\u201d. Then suddenly, he heard a tap on his window. \u201cGRRAWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, running alongside the taxi. \u201cAAAHHH\u201d said the photographer, as he lept from the taxi, hitting the pavement hard. The photographer started running. He looked around quickly, the Blue Gorilla just seconds behind him. Then, he saw it, a plane! He ran towards the pilot and screamed \u201cHELP HELP, THE BLUE GORILLA IS CHASING ME\u201d. He lept into the plane, and they took off. \u201cPhew\u201d said the Photographer, \u201cI\u2019m finally safe\u201d. then suddenly, he heard a tap on his window. \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, as he hung from the wing. \u201cAAAHHH\u201d said the photographer, as he lept from the plane. as he fell he thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019m Finally safe, I\u2019d rather splatter than be killed by the Blue Gorilla\u201d. Then he looked up \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d said the blue gorilla, as he parachuted from the plane. The photographer landed in a lake, he crawled out of the water and lay on the shore. he heard the Blue Gorilla land safely a few meters from him. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThats it\u201d he said \u201cI can\u2019t go on, i&#39;d rather be killed by the Blue Gorilla than keep running like this\u201d. The photographer stood up, he closed his eyes and waited. \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d the Blue Gorilla shrieked, as he walked closer to the photographer. Then, the Blue Gorilla walked up to the photographer, leaned in, reached out his big blue finger, carefully touched the photographer\u2019s face and said \u201cTag, you&#39;re it\u201d</p>\n\n<p>My dad told me this joke.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "The Blue Gorilla. (Warning, very long)\n\nthere was once a great photographer, who prided himself on taking a picture of every animal on earth, from the most common  bug, to the rarest fish . Well one day, at a big party celebrating the Photographer\u2019s 1,000,000th picture, an old man approached the photographer. \u201cSo\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve photographed every animal on earth have you?\u201d \u201cYep\u201d he said \u201cEvery one\u201d. the old man looked at him with doubt. \u201cHow about the Purple Gorilla\u201d he said. \u201cOf course\u201d, said the photographer. \u201cThe Red Gorilla\u201d asked the old man, \u201cone of my best\u201d said the photographer, with an air of smugness. The old man pondered for a moment \u201cWell, how about the Blue Gorilla\u201d Asked the old man. \u201cBlue Gorilla?\u201d said the photographer, \u201cTheres no such thing as a Blue Gorilla\u201d. \u201cOh yes there is\u201d said the old man \u201cHe lives on a golden throne, in the biggest room, in a huge diamond palace on top the highest mountain in the most dangerous jungle in all the Peru\u201d the old man said \u201cAnd every photographer who has ever gone looking for him, has never returned\u201d. The photographer thinks for a moment, \u201cTheres is certainly no such thing as a Blue Gorilla, is there?\u201d he thought \u201cBut if there is, then I MUST be the first to photograph it!\u201d So that very night, he bought his plane tickets to peru, and by morning, he was off.\n\n He landed at the airport in peru the next morning, and hailed a taxi. once he got in he said to the old taxi driver, \u201cTake me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d said the driver, \u201cI can\u2019t take you there, he\u2019ll rip off my arms and beat me with them! But i can take you to his jungle\u201d. so off they drove to the edge of the jungle. Once they got there the photographer was greeted by an old explorer, the photographer asked \u201cCan you take me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d says the explorer \u201cI can\u2019t take you there, he\u2019ll rip off my legs and force me to run on his treadmill! But i can take you to the base of his mountain. so they walked to the base of the mountain. Once they got there, the photographer was greeted by an old sherpa, the photographer asked \u201cCan you take me to the Blue Gorilla\u201d \u201cThe Blue Gorilla!\u201d said the sherpa \u201cI can\u2019t take you to him, he\u2019ll rip off my head and make me play football with it, but I can take you up the mountain\u201d. so they climbed up the mountain. for three days they climbed up the mountain, then four, then five, the mountain got steeper 45, 60, 75, 90, 100 degree angles they climbed, until finally, they made it.\n\n It was just like the old man said, a giant palace made entirely of diamonds. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d said the photographer, as he approached the giant diamond door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive golden door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive steel door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive iron door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive golden room, and at the end of the room was a massive copper door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive stone door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive wooden door. he grabbed the handle, and heeved the massive door open, he looked inside, and inside was a hallway, and at the end of the hallway, was a massive bead curtain. he pushed the curtain aside, and behind the curtain, was a big banquet hall, and at the end of the banquet hall, sitting on a massive throne, was a BIG, HARRY, BLUE GORILLA. \n\n\u201cOh my god\u201d the photographer said \u201cHe\u2019s real, there really is a Blue Gorilla!\u201d he took out his camera and started snapping pictures, hundreds of pictures. finally he ran out of film, and started packing his camera away, then he had a thought. \u201cHey\u201d he said \u201cThat Blue Gorilla hasn't moved the entire time i was here, he could be FAKE for all I know, I need to touch him just to be sure\u201d. So he carefully walked up to the throne, leaned over to the Blue Gorilla, reached out his hand, and gently poked his face. \n\nThe Blue Gorilla sprang out of his throne and growled \u201cGRRRAWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla. The photographer screamed! \u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big wooden door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big stone door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big copper door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big iron door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big steel door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big golden door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRRAWWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\u201cAHHH, I CAN\u2019T DIE LIKE THIS\u201d so the photographer ran behind the big diamond door and closed it. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m safe\u201d, suddenly the Blue Gorilla burst through the door! \u201cGRRRR AWWWW\u201d said the Blue Gorilla.\n\n \u201cNO\u201d, said the photographer, \u201ci\u2019d rather jump off the mountain than be killed by the Blue Gorilla!\u201d so he jumped off the mountain. as he fell he said, \u201cFinally, i\u2019m safe\u201d then he looked up \u201cGRRRR AWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, as he plummeted after the photographer! the photographer landed safely in a haystack at the mountain\u2019s base, he ran and ran, the Blue Gorilla in hot pursuit. Then, in the distance, he saw the taxi driver at the edge of the jungle. \u201cHELP HELP!\u201d he said, \u201cTHE BLUE GORILLA IS CHASING ME\u201d he quickly jumped in the back of the taxi, and they sped off. \u201cPhew\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m finally safe\u201d. Then suddenly, he heard a tap on his window. \u201cGRRAWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, running alongside the taxi. \u201cAAAHHH\u201d said the photographer, as he lept from the taxi, hitting the pavement hard. The photographer started running. He looked around quickly, the Blue Gorilla just seconds behind him. Then, he saw it, a plane! He ran towards the pilot and screamed \u201cHELP HELP, THE BLUE GORILLA IS CHASING ME\u201d. He lept into the plane, and they took off. \u201cPhew\u201d said the Photographer, \u201cI\u2019m finally safe\u201d. then suddenly, he heard a tap on his window. \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d said the Blue Gorilla, as he hung from the wing. \u201cAAAHHH\u201d said the photographer, as he lept from the plane. as he fell he thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019m Finally safe, I\u2019d rather splatter than be killed by the Blue Gorilla\u201d. Then he looked up \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d said the blue gorilla, as he parachuted from the plane. The photographer landed in a lake, he crawled out of the water and lay on the shore. he heard the Blue Gorilla land safely a few meters from him. \n\n\u201cThats it\u201d he said \u201cI can\u2019t go on, i'd rather be killed by the Blue Gorilla than keep running like this\u201d. The photographer stood up, he closed his eyes and waited. \u201cGRRRAWWWR\u201d the Blue Gorilla shrieked, as he walked closer to the photographer.
