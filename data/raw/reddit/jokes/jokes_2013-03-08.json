He picks up the snails and starts heading home, but on the way, the gentleman runs into an old friend and stops to chat for a minute. \n\nThe two get to chatting and the friend suggests, \"Wanna grab a pint?\" To which the man replies, \"No, I should really be getting back, my wife'll be pissed if I'm late for her dinner.\" So after some more minor prodding the man, of course, goes out for the one, snails in hand. The fellas get to drinking and lose track of time, drinking into the night until the man looks up at the clock and realizes, \"Shit! I'm 4 hours late for the fuckin dinner!\" So he snatches up his bag of snails and tears down the street to home. \n\nAs the man starts up his walk, stumbling and plastered, he trips on the front steps, raising a cacophony of sound and alerting his wife to his beleaguered presence. She slams open the door, looks down at the drunk, and damn near explodes. \n\n\"Where the hell have you been?! You're four hours late for dinner! Explain yourself, ya drunk bastard!\"\n\nThe man, knowing he's fucked and looking down at his sad state and the snails scattered all about, decides to take the chance.
