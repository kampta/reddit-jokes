Well, I was cleaning out her attic for her one day and I found this old army uniform and took it down, I said hey grandma, what's the story of this? It turns out, it's my grandad's old army uniform. Yeah, no fooling. My grandad, who'd been dead for years, no shit. Well, I started going through the pockets - I didn't know what else to do with the thing, so I just started going through pockets - and there was this old, yellowed, crumbled, torn piece of paper in there, just barely legible if you looked at it hard enough. My grandma asked me what it was, but I told her it was nothing. It was actually a paper from a shoemaker my grandad would go. My pop told me about it a few times. I didn't know if they were still around, or if they were still in business, but I swung by the address my pop gave me, and they were, and this man (old as Methuselah, I swear) walks up to the register. I didn't tell him about my grandad's uniform or the history of the paper I had in my hand, I just showed it to him and he scratched himself and he grunted and shuffled to the back of the store. He comes back, he looks at me, those ancient eyes, he looks at me, and he says yeah, I got your shoes.

He had tractor models, tractor wallpaper, remote control miniature tractors, tractor board games, even some tractor porn(which is not easy to find mind you). The only thing that even came close to his love for tractors, was the love he felt for his wife. His high school sweetheart, who didn&#39;t mind his infatuation with tractors one bit. She didn&#39;t even mind the role play where she would dress as a tractor, he would dress as a farmer, and he would take her for a &quot;ride&quot;. Sadly his wife was struck one day, a tractor fell off the back of a transport truck. She didn&#39;t die until he was at her side in the hospital. Her dying words &quot;don&#39;t blame the tractor honey&quot; and with that she headed to the big farm in the sky. Sadly, he did blame the tractor, he hated them now with all his mind, body, and soul. He went home and destroyed ALL his tractor related items, the toys, his wifes tractor suit, and even his collection of tractor porn. He put it all in a pile and burned it in the yard. What ever didn&#39;t burn enough to his liking was thrown into a woodchipper. He then went inside, rarely leaving his home, for 8 years. Finally on the 8th anniversary of his darling wifes death he decided it was time to get back out in the dating world, plus the cute cashier at the grocery store had been asking him out for a while now, he called her out to dinner. The restaurant he choose ended up being quite nice, good food, good service, great decor. But there was one problem, it was EXTREMELY smoky. So smoky that his date, being an asthmatic, was having some trouble breathing. After noticing her displeasure, and trouble breathing, he started breathing in. I mean REALLY breathing in. Inhaling with such force that all the smoke quickly left the dining room, and went into his lungs. When the room was void of smoke he stepped outside and released it all into the night. When he rejoined his date she asked &quot;how on earth did you do that?&quot; to which he replied, &quot;I&#39;m an extractor fan.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "There once was a man who loved tractors, I mean he absolutely LOVED them.
