So he goes on down to the local adult novelties shop to look for a dildo.  The shop owner takes him around to show him specific models so he can hand-pick one suited for his wife.  He is shown a small dildo and exclaims, &quot;That one is just too small I think...&quot;  He is shown large dildos, but they were too large.  Just as the man is about to give up, the shop owner invites him to take a look at his prized, &quot;Voodoo Dick.&quot;  Intrigued, the man opens the small ornate chest presented to him, unwraps the plush velvet encasing, and beholds a medium sized, ordinary looking dildo.  The man, disappointed, says, &quot;There doesn&#39;t look to be anything special about this one.  Why is it called the Voodoo Dick?&quot;  The shop owner&#39;s lips curl into a hint of a devious smile and he replies, &quot;This dildo is magic.  All you need to do is command the Voodoo Dick to begin thrusting.  Just say &#39;Voodoo Dick,&#39; and then the thing you want it to thrust into.&quot;  The man is flabbergasted and wants to try it out, so he exclaims, &quot;Voodoo Dick, this shop&#39;s door handle!&quot;  And instantly, the dildo flies out of the chest and starts pounding on the door handle.  Amazed, the man says &quot;I&#39;ll take it!&quot; and heads home knowing his wife will not stray from him while he is gone with her new toy.  Once home, the man explains to his wife how the dildo works, gives her a small demonstration to prove it, and begins packing for his trip.</p>\n\n<p>3 days into the man&#39;s trip, the wife begins to get horny.  She is tempted by visions of young, handsome men doing yard-work around the neighborhood, but she is still a little unsure about using the Voodoo Dick.  The next day, unable to keep herself satiated any longer, she opens the small, ornate chest, and pulls out the dildo, saying &quot;Voodoo Dick, my pussy.&quot;  Instantly the Voodoo Dick begins to pound on her, and in minutes she was satisfied.  With the Voodoo Dick still throbbing and thrusting inside of her, she had a horrific sudden realization.  Nobody told her how to get it to stop!  Her only hope is that after a time it will simply stop on its own, so she allows it to continue until she has climaxed thrice more.  Now thoroughly satisfied, she is more than ready for the dildo to quit, but it will not.  It continues to pound her harder and harder and the wife begins to get very scared.  The only thing she can think is to get to the hospital, and maybe they could help her.  She puts on a maternity dress to cover up the still violently thrusting dildo and gets into her car to head for help.  On the way she has a sudden and strong orgasm, which causes her to careen into the ditch in the highway&#39;s median.  Exasperated, she begins to cry and doesn&#39;t know what to do.  Luckily, a police officer was riding a few cars behind her and saw the whole accident.  He immediately pulls over and runs to the window to ask the woman if she is okay.  The wife, extremely frustrated, and knowing her story sounds unbelievable replies, &quot;NO I&#39;M NOT OKAY!  I&#39;VE GOT A LARGE MAGIC DILDO CALLED A VOODOO DICK RAMMING ME OVER AND OVER!  IT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT!&quot;  Incredulous, the police officer begins to chuckle.  Then that chuckle gradually turns into an uproarious cackling because he simply cannot believe what he just heard.
