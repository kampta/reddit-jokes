The \nwife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, &#39;I&#39;ll give you $800 to drop that towel.&#39; After thinking for a \nmoment, the woman   drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob, after a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 \nand leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her \nhusband asks, &#39;Who was that?&#39; It was Bob the next door neighbour,&#39; she replies. &#39;Great,&#39; the husband says, &#39;did he \nsay anything about the $800 he owes me?&#39;\nMoral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you \nmay be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure</p>\n\n<p>Lesson 2: A priest offered a Nun a lift. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest \nnearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said, &#39;Father, \nremember Psalm 129?&#39; The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again.\nThe nun once again said, &#39;Father, remember Psalm 129?&#39; The priest apologized &#39;Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.&#39;\nArriving at the convent, the nun sighed heavily and went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the \npriest   rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, &#39;Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.&#39;\nMoral of the story: If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Lesson 3: A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil \nlamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, &#39;I&#39;ll give each of you just one wish.&#39; &#39;Me first! Me first!&#39; \nsays the admin clerk. &#39;I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.&#39; Puff! She&#39;s \ngone. &#39;Me next! Me next!&#39; says the sales rep. &#39;I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal\nmasseuse, an endless supply of Pinna Coladas and the love of my life.&#39; Puff! He&#39;s gone. &#39;OK, you&#39;re up,&#39; the Genie \nsays to the manager. The manager says, &#39;I want those two back in the office after lunch.&#39;\nMoral of the story: Always let your boss have the first say.</p>\n\n<p>Lesson 4: An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, &#39;Can I \nalso sit like you and do nothing?&#39; The eagle answered: &#39;Sure, why not.&#39; So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the \neagle and rested.

The \nwife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, 'I'll give you $800 to drop that towel.' After thinking for a \nmoment, the woman   drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob, after a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 \nand leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her \nhusband asks, 'Who was that?' It was Bob the next door neighbour,' she replies. 'Great,' the husband says, 'did he \nsay anything about the $800 he owes me?'\nMoral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you \nmay be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure\n\nLesson 2: A priest offered a Nun a lift. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest \nnearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said, 'Father, \nremember Psalm 129?' The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again.\nThe nun once again said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?' The priest apologized 'Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.'\nArriving at the convent, the nun sighed heavily and went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the \npriest   rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, 'Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.'\nMoral of the story: If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.\n\nLesson 3: A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil \nlamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, 'I'll give each of you just one wish.' 'Me first! Me first!' \nsays the admin clerk. 'I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.' Puff! She's \ngone. 'Me next! Me next!' says the sales rep. 'I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal\nmasseuse, an endless supply of Pinna Coladas and the love of my life.' Puff! He's gone. 'OK, you're up,' the Genie \nsays to the manager. The manager says, 'I want those two back in the office after lunch.'\nMoral of the story: Always let your boss have the first say.\n\nLesson 4: An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.
