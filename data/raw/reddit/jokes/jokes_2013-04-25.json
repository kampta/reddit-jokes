So Jesus asks moses, \"hey Moses...you still got da funk?\" Moses says \"yeah buddy!\", and walks out to the sea, holds up his staff, and majestically makes the Red Sea part in the middle. \nHe puts his staff down, walks back, and asks, \"so how bout you JC? do you still got da funk?\" \nJesus replies, \"I don't know man, its been a long time, but let me try\". \nJesus walks to the sea and begins to walk on water. He takes a couple steps, but then sinks into the water. He walks back very sad. \"well moses, I guess I just don't have it in me anymore\". \n\"Hey don't feel so bad Jesus\", Moses replies, \"last time you did that, you didn't have those holes in your feet\".\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Jesus and Moses are hanging out by the Red Sea", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1d2dqi", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1d2dqi/jesus_and_moses_are_hanging_out_by_the_red_sea/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1d2dqi", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ImmanualKant", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1d2dqi/jesus_and_moses_are_hanging_out_by_the_red_sea/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1366896151.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1d2dqi/jesus_and_moses_are_hanging_out_by_the_red_sea/", "created_utc": 1366867351.0, "ups": 13, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Boobees!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Boobees!!!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "What type of bee makes milk instead of honey?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1d2cy0", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1d2cy0/what_type_of_bee_makes_milk_instead_of_honey/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1d2cy0", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eazar", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1d2cy0/what_type_of_bee_makes_milk_instead_of_honey/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1366895305.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1d2cy0/what_type_of_bee_makes_milk_instead_of_honey/", "created_utc": 1366866505.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>and one day they see an abandoned house and go inside.
