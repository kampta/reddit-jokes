But almost everyone on this plane was either fat as can be or ugly as sin and they all had been bullied their entire lives due to this.  \nSo god lines everyone up and says \"You've all been good people but were treated terribly during life, so I will grant you one wish before you enter heaven.\"  \nThe first guy thinks for a second and says \"I wish I could spend eternity as a good looking man.\" and so god changes him into a good looking man and the guy happily goes through the pearly gates.  \nThe second guy sees this and says \"I wish to spend eternity as a good looking man!\" and god obliges, but he starts to hear a faint giggle at the end of the line.\n\nEach person in line wishes for the same thing: to be good looking.  And after each wish the laughter gets louder and louder.  So finally god gets to the end of the line to the laughing man and says \"And what exactly is so funny?\" and the guy says \"I wish they were all ugly again!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A plane crashes and everyone dies", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_ujavo", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ujavo/a_plane_crashes_and_everyone_dies/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "ujavo", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AdmiralSkippy", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 140, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ujavo/a_plane_crashes_and_everyone_dies/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1338796513.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ujavo/a_plane_crashes_and_everyone_dies/", "created_utc": 1338767713.0, "ups": 140, "num_comments": 23}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>They&#39;re not going to fall for that one again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "They're not going to fall for that one again.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Why don't black people go on cruises?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_ujabs", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ujabs/why_dont_black_people_go_on_cruises/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "ujabs", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mastabates17", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 283, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ujabs/why_dont_black_people_go_on_cruises/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1338795858.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ujabs/why_dont_black_people_go_on_cruises/", "created_utc": 1338767058.0, "ups": 283, "num_comments": 21}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>If you answered &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
