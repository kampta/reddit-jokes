The hunter shoots the bear\u2026 The mouse grabs the cheese sandwich\u2026 The cat jumps for the mouse\u2026 The mouse ducks\u2026The cat falls into the water and drowns.\n \nThe moral of the story is: Whenever a fly goes down three inches\u2026 Somewhere there\u2019s a pussy in trouble.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Morals", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_swn6b", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/swn6b/morals/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "swn6b", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ninja_Penguin298", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/swn6b/morals/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1335636445.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/swn6b/morals/", "created_utc": 1335607645.0, "ups": 41, "num_comments": 2}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "**.**", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "There is nothing funny about PMS", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_swm6m", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/swm6m/there_is_nothing_funny_about_pms/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "swm6m", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RockofStrength", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/swm6m/there_is_nothing_funny_about_pms/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1335632803.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/swm6m/there_is_nothing_funny_about_pms/", "created_utc": 1335604003.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A man walks into a doctors office and says to the doctor &quot;I want you to castrate me&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The doctor says &quot;NO!
