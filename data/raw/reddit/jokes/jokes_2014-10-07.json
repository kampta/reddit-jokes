Just describe it.\"\n\n\"OK, I want a pastoral scene with rolling meadows and woods in the background, and pretty clouds . . . Well, I can't think what else.\"\n\nThe proprietor says, \"Let me help you. How about a winding stream through the meadow, and a country road crossing the stream on a stone bridge?\"\n\n\"Good, good! What else?\"\n\n\"There should be a big oak tree in the meadow on the left, for variety, and ducks and swans in the stream . . .\"\n\n\"Yes, perfect! You seem to see just what I want. Anything else?\n\n\"How about a canoe coming down the stream with a couple of lovers in it?\"\n\n\"No, that's a little corny, but everything else is just what I want.\"\n\n\"Very good,' says the proprietor, \"Our landscape artist will create your vision for you. Come back in two weeks.\"\n\nThe customer pays a deposit and goes out happy. The proprietor strolls over to the open door to the back room and calls out,\n\n\"One landscape, hold the canoe!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "At the Art Store", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2ik3c4", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2ik3c4/at_the_art_store/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2ik3c4", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "beenthereonce2", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2ik3c4/at_the_art_store/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1412717614.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2ik3c4/at_the_art_store/", "created_utc": 1412688814.0, "ups": 2, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Michigan State Police have announced the discovery of an arms cache of 200 semi-automatic rifles with 250,000 rounds of ammunition, 10 anti-tank missiles, 4 grenade launchers, 2 tons of heroin, $12 million in forged bills and a ring of 14 prostitutes, all in a housing project behind the Detroit Public Library. </p>\n\n<p>Detroit folks were stunned.</p>\n\n<p>A community organizer said: &quot;We be shocked.
