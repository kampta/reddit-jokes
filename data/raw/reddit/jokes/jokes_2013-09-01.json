A hidden security guard watches as the robber appears to be losing control and is afraid he may shoot people.  The security guard realizes he may only have one chance at this, so he takes aim at the robber, and carefully fires, taking him down in one shot.  As the robber falls, he gets off three shots, all hitting the pregnant woman in the stomach.  She is immediately rushed to the hospital and stays in emergency surgery for a while.  As she comes out from being under general anesthesia, there&#39;s a doctor standing over her telling her she&#39;s going to be alright.  The woman then asks the doctor how her baby is going to be?  The doctor smiles and tells her, &quot;actually, you&#39;re going to have triplets, 2 girls and a boy.  They all have a bullet lodged in their body that will pass out through normal metabolism.&quot;  The woman stays in the hospital for a few more days before returning home.  She eventually has 2 girls and a boy and around 12 years later, she is at home in the kitchen doing dishes.  One of the girls comes running out of the bathroom with a very worried look on her face.
