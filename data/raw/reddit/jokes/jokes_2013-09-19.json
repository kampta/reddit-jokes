Things were getting hot and heavy between them when the male martian took off his pants and said to the woman, \"Well, what do you think?\"  She said, \"Well, to be honest, it's smaller than what I'm used to, but I guess it's ok.\"\n\nThe martian said, \"No, no, that's not all.  You see, you pull on my left ear to make it bigger. And you pull on my right ear to make it wider. That way it grows to exactly the size you like.\"  The woman said, \"oh wow,\" pulled on his ears, and they had great sex.\n\nLater on, she met back up with her boyfriend and she said, \"Well, how was it for you?\"  He replied, \"I guess it would have been ok, but it was hard to concentrate because she just kept on tugging on my ears!\"  ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Pull on my ears!", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1mo2ea", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mo2ea/pull_on_my_ears/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "1mo2ea", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "monycaw", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mo2ea/pull_on_my_ears/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1379567344.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1mo2ea/pull_on_my_ears/", "created_utc": 1379538544.0, "ups": 28, "num_comments": 1}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>... because all the slow ones are in Jail</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "... because all the slow ones are in Jail\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Why are Black people so fast?
