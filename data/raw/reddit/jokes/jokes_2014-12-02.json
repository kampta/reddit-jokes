Amusing kick.\nJudge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. \nJudge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that&#39;s the worst one. These Texans are crazy.</p>\n\n<p>CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN &#39;S AFTERBURNER CHILI </p>\n\n<p>Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.\nJudge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.\nJudge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children.  I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face. </p>\n\n<p>CHILI # 3 - FRED&#39;S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI</p>\n\n<p>Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick.\nJudge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.\nJudge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I&#39;ve located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone know s the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest.

Very impressive.\nJudge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. \nJudge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage.

Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic. Superb. \nJudge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I&#39;m worried it  will eat through the chair.   No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can&#39;t feel my lips anymore.
