We couldn't have been happier, his name is Jamal.\" His mate looked at him with disbelief. \"You won't believe this.\" As his friend rifled through his pictures he pulled out one that made both of them drop their jaws. \"I just adopted a young Spanish boy with my wife not too long ago too, look they look identical! I think we adopted twins that were separated at birth! That is to much to be a mere coincidence. My sons name is Juan and he is the biggest motivation I have to make it back home.\"\n\nAfter much conversation, they agreed that when they got back to the states they would meet up and let their boys meet each other.
