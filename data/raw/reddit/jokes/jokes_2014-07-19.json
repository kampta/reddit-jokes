He\nrespectfully approached the Italian man walking the dog and\nsaid: \"I am so sorry for your loss, and this may be a bad\ntime to disturb you, but I've never seen an Italian\nfuneral like this.Whose funeral is it?\"\n\"My wife's.\"\n''What happened to her?\"\n\"She yelled at me and my dog attacked and killed\nher.\"He inquired further, \"But who is in the\nsecond hearse?\"\nThe Italian man answered, \"My mother-in-law. She was\ntrying to help my wife when the dog turned on\nher.\"A very poignant and touching moment of\nItalian brotherhood and silence passed between the two\nmen.\n      \n            \n\"Can I borrow the dog?\"  \n     \n            \nThe man replied, \"Get in\nline.\"         ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "True Italian Dog Story", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2b30zs", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2b30zs/true_italian_dog_story/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2b30zs", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EarthTraveller", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2b30zs/true_italian_dog_story/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1405749269.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2b30zs/true_italian_dog_story/", "created_utc": 1405720469.0, "ups": 14, "num_comments": 0}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>&quot;There, they&#39;re, their.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "\"There, they're, their.\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "How do you comfort a grammar nazi?", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_2b2zp7", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2b2zp7/how_do_you_comfort_a_grammar_nazi/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "2b2zp7", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TruckasaurusLex", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 115, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2b2zp7/how_do_you_comfort_a_grammar_nazi/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1405748448.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2b2zp7/how_do_you_comfort_a_grammar_nazi/", "created_utc": 1405719648.0, "ups": 115, "num_comments": 13}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Pistorius.
