At the top is the realm of the complete, perfect Cheerios. These Cheerios live a life of luxury, with as much food and drink as they want, and little work to do. The second level of the box, the middle layer, is occupied by the imperfect but still mostly whole. These Cheerios have to work to survive, but life is manageable. The lowest level is occupied by the broken, destroyed fragments of Cheerios, that small children refuse to eat, and it is these Cheerios that must fight to survive in the dog-eat-dog world of the lower box.\n\nThe protagonist of our story is a Cheerio crumb from the lower box. For the sake of the story, this Cheerio's name is Jake. Jake had been born in the lower box, but had heard stories of the immense wealth of the Cheerios in the top layer.
