It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. \n\nI worked until one o'clock , when Rick knocked on my door and said, 'You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.' \n\nI said, 'Thanks, Rick, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!' \n\nWe went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. He chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. \n\nOn the way back to the office, Rick said, 'You know, It's such a beautiful day...we don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?' \n\nI responded, 'I guess not. What do you have in mind?' \n\nHe said, 'Let's drop by my place, it's just around the corner.' \n\nAfter arriving at his house, Rick turned to me and said, 'If you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.' \n\n'Ok.' I nervously replied. \n\nHe went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, he came out carrying a huge birthday cake, followed by my husband , my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing 'Happy Birthday'. \n\nAnd I just sat there.... \n\non the couch.... \n\nnaked.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0,
