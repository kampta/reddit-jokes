I quickly go inside and get my hammer, with which I finally manage to get him to let go. Then I see the bastard landed safe on a bush. So in a fit of rage I grab my fridge and throw it over the edge. I guess the stress was all too much for me because I had a heart attack then and there.\"\n\n\"sho!\" says St Peter, \"Thats pretty bad, go through.\"\n\nFinally the third guy steps forward....\"Picture this....I'm hiding naked in a fridge!\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Three men approach the pearly gates.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_284got", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/284got/three_men_approach_the_pearly_gates/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "284got", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wazza02", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/284got/three_men_approach_the_pearly_gates/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1402771837.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/284got/three_men_approach_the_pearly_gates/", "created_utc": 1402743037.0, "ups": 10, "num_comments": 2}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The Secretary General of the UN decides to give them a test.
