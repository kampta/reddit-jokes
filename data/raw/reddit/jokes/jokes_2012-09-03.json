When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbour. Bob looks a bit flustered from seeing her in the towel, but smiles and says, \"I\u2019ll give you $800 to drop that towel.\" After thinking about it she realises she has the chance of earning $800 within a minute, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob, after a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 and leaves. \n\nThe woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, \"Who was that?\" \"It was Bob the next door neighbour,\" she replies. \"Great,\" the husband says, \"Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Wife just got out the shower...", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_z9crk", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/z9crk/wife_just_got_out_the_shower/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "z9crk", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dcisbabe", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 1580, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/z9crk/wife_just_got_out_the_shower/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1346667626.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/z9crk/wife_just_got_out_the_shower/", "created_utc": 1346638826.0, "ups": 1580, "num_comments": 108}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><em>To the tune of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>Tinkle, tinkle, little cat</p>\n\n<p>Where is it that you&#39;ve peed at? </p>\n\n<p>There, upon my cupboards high</p>\n\n<p>My antique plates, no longer dry</p>\n\n<p>Tinkle, tinkle, little cat</p>\n\n<p>Could be worse, you could&#39;ve shat! </p>\n\n<p><em>Thank you!

How about we do it to each other? Bend over boys.</p>\n\n<p>9) Being A Drip - Are they kidding? Our tissues are for wiping off our mascara that has smudged on our faces after laughing so hard. We thought men liked to LAY IN IT.</p>\n\n<p>10) Clock Watching - What time does Survivor come on? I wonder if Tommy called. Ho Hum. Is it in yet? </p>\n\n<p>11) Fishing For Compliments - It&#39;s a compliment if they can remember our names after sex, isn&#39;t it ladies?</p>\n\n<p>12) Playing Dead - Well, if they&#39;re a dud there&#39;s no use in expending unnecessary energy, now is there. Afterall, we have to conserve our energy for cardio in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>13) Being Possessive - We&#39;re not possessive at all. We&#39;d love to shag your friends. The more the merrier. Perhaps we&#39;ll stop playing dead. Bring &#39;em on!</p>\n\n<p>14) Not Keeping Your Hair On - This is news to us. We thought you liked thinking you were shagging the 12 year old down the street. All those nics and cuts for nothing.

Afterall, we have to conserve our energy for cardio in the morning.\n\n13) Being Possessive - We're not possessive at all. We'd love to shag your friends. The more the merrier. Perhaps we'll stop playing dead. Bring 'em on!\n\n14) Not Keeping Your Hair On - This is news to us. We thought you liked thinking you were shagging the 12 year old down the street. All those nics and cuts for nothing. Now we can grow it out and you can shag a troll doll.\n\n15) Spitting It Out - If we've reached our protein intake for the day than it's not necessary to swallow. We'll have to check our diet journal to see if we can fit that meal in.\n\n16) Being Ungrateful - We are VERY grateful when they've found the right hole, the man in the boat, we still have the hair on our lovely heads, didn't chip a nail, mascara is relatively intact and we can get home in time to watch Survivor (or look at George Clooney).\n\n17 Seeking Favors - The only favor we ask as you drift off into your well-deserved slumber is to please not fart in your sleep and to lay on the puddle yourself.
