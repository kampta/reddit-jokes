Now, curiosity has always been wont to get the better of me, and today was no different. With a little bit of discrete eavesdropping, I manage to pick up that they&#39;re discussing something called a &quot;purple people eater.&quot; In an admittedly rash decision, I ask them, &quot;Hey guys, what&#39;s a purple people eater?&quot; They stiffen up, give me a weird look, and call the teacher over, saying, &quot;Teacher, TheYear20XX is asking about purple people eaters!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Visibly confused and distressed, the teacher asks me if I have anything to say for myself. I say, &quot;Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn&#39;t know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called you over. So, teacher, what&#39;s a purple people eater?&quot; The teacher becomes seemingly enraged, but as she is currently teaching a class, she restrains herself and very intensely tells me to go to the principal&#39;s office. Not wanting to enrage her further, I head down there.</p>\n\n<p>When I get to the office, the receptionist gives me a smile asks what she can do for me. I say, &quot;Well, I was sitting in class when I heard some guys talking about a purple people eater. I didn&#39;t know what it was, so I asked them what a purple people eater was. They called the teacher over, so I asked her what a purple people eater was. She told me to go to the principal&#39;s office, and here I am. So, receptionist, what&#39;s a purple people eater?&quot; The receptionist gives me a look of sheer disgust, goes straight to the principal&#39;s office, comes back, and waves me in without a word.</p>\n\n<p>When I enter the office, the principal asks me what trouble I&#39;ve gotten into now.

So, principal, what&#39;s a purple people eater?&quot; The principal doesn&#39;t respond and instead stares into the distance. In a voice trembling with fear, she says, &quot;Son, I&#39;m sorry, but this is for your own good.&quot; She then writes me a month&#39;s suspension and tells me to go home.</p>\n\n<p>When I get home, my mom is very confused as to why I&#39;m not at school.

My cheek still stinging, he says that I am no longer any son of his and tells me to pack my bags and get out of his house.</p>\n\n<p>Without many other options, I throw some clothes in a suitcase, gather some money, and walk out the door.
