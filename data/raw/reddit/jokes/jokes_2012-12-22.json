The best poem gets the job.\" Both men accept the instructions and retreat to their respective rooms. 5 minutes later, out pops the Pole, claiming he is done.\n\n\"Fine, that's fine.\" Says the hiring manager dismissively. \"But, we still need to wait for the other applicant to finish.\" The Polak sat patiently holding his poem. Utilizing all his time, the Harvard graduate emerged from his room with seconds to spare.\n\n\"Well done,\" said the hiring manager. \"Now let's hear them. Why don't you go first?\" he asked the Harvard graduate, anticipating the superior submission.\n\nThe grad began, \"I was walking across the desert sand,\nWhen I came across a caravan.\nThey took me in and saw me through\nTo the American embassy in Timbuktu.\"\n\n\"Very, very good.\" exclaimed the hiring manager. \"Now let's hear your's, Mr. Polak.\"\n\nThe Pole approached the podium, clearing his throat. \"Tim and I, a-hunting went.\nCame across three cunt in a tent.\nThem being three and us being two,\nI bucked one, and Tim bucked two.\"\n\nEdit: This is the earliest long joke I remember. I heard it told to my father by my uncle around age 3 and remembered every word since. I remember reciting it for the folks on many of their get-togethers.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked":
