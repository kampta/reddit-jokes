Then she saw an envelope propped up in the center of the bed. It was addressed, \"Mom\". With the worst premonition, she opened the envelope with trembling hands: \n\n\"Dear Mum, it is with great regret & sorrow that I'm writing to you, I had to elope with my new boyfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with you and Dad. I've been finding real passion with him & he is so nice, even with all his piercings, tattoos, beard, and motorcycle clothes. But it's not just the passion Mum, I'm pregnant and he said that we will be very happy. He already owns a trailor in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. He wants to have many more children with me and that is now one of my dreams too. He taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and trading it with his friends for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime we'll pray that science finds a cure for AIDS so he can get better, he sure deserves it! Don't worry Mum, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Someday I'm sure we'll be back to visit so u can get to know your grandchildren. Your daughter, Sophie... P.S. Mum, none of the above is true. I'm over at the neighbors house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than my report card that's in my desk top drawer. I love you!
