BUSH: We don\u2019t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either for us or against us. There is no middle ground here people...\nDICK CHENEY: Where\u2019s my gun?\nBill Clinton: I said it before and i ll say it again: I did not cross the road with that chicken. \nAL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white? We need some black chickens.\nDR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won\u2019t realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he\u2019s acting by not taking on his current problems before adding new problems.\nOPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I\u2019m going to give this chicken a NEW CAR so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN: We have reason to believe that a chicken just crossed the road, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road to verify this information.\nPAT BUCHANAN: It crossed the road to steal the crop of other decent, hardworking American chickens.\nMARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer\u2019s Market to sell my eggs when the chicken arrived at a certain point. No little bird gave me any insider information.\nDR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but whether it was alone...it is totally unknown.\nERNEST HEMINGWAY: Why? but to die in the rain, alone.\nJERRY FALWELL: Because the chicken was gay! Can\u2019t you people see the plain truth? That\u2019s why they call it the \u2018other side.\u2019 Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like \u2018the other side.\u2019 That chicken should not be crossing the road. It\u2019s as plain and as simple as that.\nGRANDPA: In my day we didn\u2019t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.\nBARBARA WALTERS: Isn\u2019t that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.\nARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.\nJOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens being on spree, Imagine there aren&#39;t any coops,\nIt isn&#39;t hard to do, Nothing be locked and free an&#39; all, And no wires too, Imagine all the chickens, Living without cease, The whole world not eating fowl, Together all in peace...ahhh yahh yahhh yah...\nBILL GATES: I have just released eChicken8, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken8. This new platform is much more stable then the last, and will never reboot.\nALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?\nHILLARY CLINTON: When I was First Lady, I personally helped that little chicken to cross the road. This experience makes me uniquely qualified to ensure right from Day One that every chicken in this country gets the chance it deserves to cross the road. But then, this really isn\u2019t about me.\nCOLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.\nJOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it!
