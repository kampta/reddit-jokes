They make a plan, much like the one they made to escape from the bottom layer, and eventually get to the top layer of the box.</p>\n\n<p>Here, in the top layer of the box, they feel on top of the world! They&#39;re going to all the nicest restaurants, they have the nicest clothes, they spend their time with the best people. It&#39;s just heaven to them. They both are enjoying the best that life has to offer them, and they could not be happier. </p>\n\n<p>One night, after a long afternoon of enjoying themselves, they decide to sit down for a nice meal at one of the finest restaurants in the city.

The top layer - this is the best place for the cheerios to live. All the best houses, the best cars, the best restaurants, etc, are in this part of the box. The ritziest cheerios live here, and everything is expensive and clean. There are no broken cheerios or cheerio dust here. It's just beautiful. \n\n2. The middle layer - not nearly as nice as the top layer of the box, but still fairly nice. It has decent living and some good restaurants and stores, but not as fancy as the top layer. People still like it here, and it's basically just the middle class of the box. Most of the cheerios are intact, and it's fairly clean, although you do get some dust and broken pieces.\n\n3. The bottom layer - definitely the worst layer to live it. A lot of the cheerios are broken, plenty of cheerio dust, and it's the dirstiest, most run-down place in the box. Cheerios do not like living in this part of the box. It's the ghetto part of the box.\n\nOne day, two cheerios are living in the bottom layer of the box. They are utterly miserable, and just want to get out of the bottom layer. So, they devise a plan to get out of the bottom layer and get to the middle layer. They try the plan, and it fails, but they try it a few more times, and eventually get to the middle layer.\n\nSo, they're living in the middle layer for a little while, and definitely enjoying it, but after a while they grow tired of their boring, average life, and think they can finally get to the top layer of the box. They make a plan, much like the one they made to escape from the bottom layer, and eventually get to the top layer of the box.\n\nHere, in the top layer of the box, they feel on top of the world! They're going to all the nicest restaurants, they have the nicest clothes, they spend their time with the best people. It's just heaven to them. They both are enjoying the best that life has to offer them, and they could not be happier. \n\nOne night, after a long afternoon of enjoying themselves, they decide to sit down for a nice meal at one of the finest restaurants in the city.
