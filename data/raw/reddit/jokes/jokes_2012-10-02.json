In Miami there are a shit ton of Cubans so everyday life is pretty funny since you come across funny pronounciations due to the broken English. Also, Cuban people are very proud and confident and speaking English for them is a big deal and they show it off all the time.\n\nThe joke is that the guy heard someone say Jurassic Park is a good movie but they said it in English. So when he went to rent it he wanted to show off his English skills and tried to translate Jurassic park but instead he translated \"your ass is a park\" or \"tu Culo es un parque\" its pretty freaking hilarious if your a Cuban American living in Miami...", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Funny Spanish joke with english explanation", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_10rrjp", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/10rrjp/funny_spanish_joke_with_english_explanation/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "10rrjp", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pimpinpinguino", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/10rrjp/funny_spanish_joke_with_english_explanation/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1349143200.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/10rrjp/funny_spanish_joke_with_english_explanation/", "created_utc": 1349114400.0, "ups": 0, "num_comments": 2}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The recruitment official turned him away, however, stating that there can not be any chinks in their knights&#39; armor.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "The recruitment official turned him away, however, stating that there can not be any chinks in their knights' armor.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "A Japanese man wished to join the knights of England.", "_has_fetched": true, "_comment_sort": null, "_replaced_more": false, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "_info_url": "https://api.reddit.com/api/info/", "downs": 0, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "from_id": null, "locked": false, "name": "t3_10rpwl", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Jokes", "_comments_by_id": {}, "_api_link": "https://api.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/10rpwl/a_japanese_man_wished_to_join_the_knights_of/?ref=search_posts", "media_embed": {}, "secure_media": null, "id": "10rpwl", "from_kind": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Evan12203", "media": null, "_orphaned": {}, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "_uniq": null, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "reddit_session": "Unauthenticated reddit session", "mod_reports": [], "from": null, "is_self": true, "_comments": null, "_params": {}, "_underscore_names": null, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/10rpwl/a_japanese_man_wished_to_join_the_knights_of/?ref=search_posts", "stickied": false, "created": 1349141649.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/10rpwl/a_japanese_man_wished_to_join_the_knights_of/", "created_utc": 1349112849.0, "ups": 4, "num_comments": 3}, {"json_dict": null, "banned_by": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh72", "subreddit": "Jokes", "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>He could open up a steakhouse called <em>Hoof-Loose</em>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "He could open up a steakhouse called *Hoof-Loose*.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "Someday Kevin Bacon will become a restauranteur...
