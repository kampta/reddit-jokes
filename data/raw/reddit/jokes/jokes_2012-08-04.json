A bee went inside my wife and it might be dangerous!\"\nThe doctor laid the woman down on the table, spread her legs and looked inside.\n\n\"Yes, I see. The bee is right between the salpinx and the ovary. It could be dangerous - slightest movement, the bee stings in the ovary, infection and no kids\".\n\nThe husband got nervous: \"Doc, what do we do, maybe you'll take it out with a pincette?\".\n\n\"I thought about it, it's dangerous - slightest movement, the bee stings in the ovary, infection and no kids\".\n\n\"So what do we do Doc?\", asked the young husband.\n\nThe doctor pondered and pondered, and finally suggested an idea: \"You'll take out your penis, we'll put honey on the edge of it. Then you'll get it inside, the bee will see the honey, follow it, you will pull out and it will follow\".\n\nThe husband's face changed colors: \"But what if it will sting my penis?\".\n\n\"You're right\", answered the doctor, \"Tell you what - I'll do the service for you.\"\n\nThe husband calmed down and watched the doctor taking out his penis and putting honey on it. The doctor started entering the wife slowly; the wife started moving restlessly. The doctor sticked in his penis dipper and faster; the wife was moaning slightly. Suddenly the doctor started moving at a crazy pace - the wife screamed with joy - and the doctor didn't show signs of pulling out.\n\n\"Doc, Doc, what are you doing?!\" asked the husband.\n\n\"I've changed tactics - I'm gonna drown the motherfucker\".\n\n-------------------------\n\nIf you know Hebrew and want to read the original here is the
