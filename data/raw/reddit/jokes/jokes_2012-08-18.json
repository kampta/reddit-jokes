The new bride comes out of the bathroom showered and wearing a beautiful robe. The proud husband says, &quot;My dear, we are married now, you can open your robe.&quot; The beautiful young woman opens her robe, and he is astonished.&quot;Oh, oh, aaaahhh,&quot; he exclaims, &quot;My God you are so beautiful, let me take your picture. Puzzled she asks, &quot;My picture?&quot; He answers, &quot;Yes my dear, so I can carry your beauty next to my heart forever&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>She smiles and he takes her picture, and then he heads into the bathroom to shower. He comes out wearing his robe and the new wife asks, &quot;Why do you wear a robe? We are married now.&quot; At that the man opens his robe and she exclaims, &quot;oh, OH, OH MY, let me get a picture&quot;. He beams and asks why and she answers, &quot;So I can get it enlarged!&quot; </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A woman was shaking out a rug on the balcony of her 17th floor condominium when a sudden gust of wind blew her over the railing. &quot;Damn, that was stupid,&quot; she thought as she fell. &quot;What a way to die.&quot; As she passed the 14th floor, a man standing at his railing caught her in his arms. While she looked at him in disbelieving gratitude, he asked, &quot;Do you suck?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; she shrieked, aghast. So, he dropped her. As she passed the 12th floor, another man reached out and caught her. &quot;Do you screw?&quot; he asked. &quot;Of course not!&quot; she exclaimed before she could stop herself. He dropped her, too. The poor woman prayed to God for one more chance. As luck would have it, she was caught a third time, by a man on the eighth floor. &quot;I suck! I screw!&quot; she screamed in panic. &quot;~censored~!&quot; he said, and dropped her. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Before the inauguration, George W. was invited to a &#39;get acquainted&#39; tour of the White House. \nAfter drinking several glasses of iced tea, he asked President Clinton if he could use his personal bathroom. He was astonished to see that the President had a solid gold urinal! \nThat afternoon, George W. told his wife, Laura, about the urinal. &quot;Just think,&quot; he said, &quot;when I am President, I&#39;ll have my own personal gold urinal!&quot; \nLater, when Laura had lunch with Hillary at her tour of the White House, she told Hillary how impressed George had been with his discovery of the fact that, in the President&#39;s private bathroom, the President had a gold urinal. \nThat evening, Bill and Hillary were getting ready for bed. Hillary turned to Bill and said, &quot;Well, I found out who pissed in your saxophone.&quot; </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A man limps into a bar with a cane and alligator. The bartender stops him and says &quot;Hold on a second here - you can&#39;t bring that animal in here, they aren&#39;t allowed!&quot; So the man says, &quot;But my gator here does a really cool trick...&quot; \nThe bartender says &quot;Well then, lets see!&quot; So the man whips out his ~censored~ and shoves it in the gators mouth. He then takes his cane and starts bashing the gator in the head with it. A crowd gathers around and everyone is astonished when he pulls out his ~censored~ without a single scratch. \nHe looks around at the crowd and says, &quot;Does anyone else want to try?&quot; An old lady raises her hand and says...&quot;Sure, but don&#39;t hit me with that stick.&quot; </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A new guy in town walks into a bar and reads a sign that hangs over the bar... FREE BEER! FREE BEER FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN PASS THE TEST! So the guy asks the bartender what the test is. \nBartender replies &quot;Well, first you have to drink that whole gallon of pepper tequila, the WHOLE thing at once and you can&#39;t make a face while doing it. Second, there&#39;s a &#39;gator out back with a sore tooth...you have to remove it with your bare hands. Third, there&#39;s a woman up-stairs who&#39;s never had an orgasm. You gotta make things right for her.&quot; The guy says, &quot;Well, as much as I would love free beer, I won&#39;t do it. You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then get crazier from there. \nWell, as time goes on and the man drinks a few, he asks, &quot;Wherez zat teeqeelah?&quot; \nHe grabs the gallon of tequilla with both hands, and downs it with a big slurp and tears streaming down his face. Next, he staggers out back and soon all the people inside hear the most frightening roaring and thumping, then silence. The man staggers back into the bar, his shirt ripped and big scratches all over his body. \n&quot;Now&quot; he says &quot;Where&#39;s that woman with the sore tooth?&quot; </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A little guy gets on a plane and sits next to the window. \nA while later , a big , strong , mean-looking guy plops down in the seat next to him , and immediately falls asleep. \nThe little guy starts to feel a little airsick , but he&#39;s afraid to wake the big guy up so he can go to the bathroom. \nHe knows he can&#39;t climb over him , so he just sits there , looks at the big guy and tries to decide what to do. \nSuddenly , the plane hits an air pocket and an uncontrollable wave of nausea passes thru the little guy. \nHe can&#39;t hold it any longer and he pukes all over the big guy&#39;s chest. \nThen , the big guy wakes up , looks down and sees the vomit all over him. \n&quot;So,&quot; says the little guy , &quot;Are you feeling better now?&quot; </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>A guy phones up his Boss, but gets the bosses&#39; wife instead. \n&quot;I&#39;m afraid he died last week.&quot; she explains. The next day the man calls again and asks for the boss. &quot;I told you&quot; the wife replies, &quot;he died last week.&quot; \nThe next day he calls again and once more asks to speak to his boss. By this time the wife is getting upset and shouts, &quot;I&#39;VE ALREADY TOLD YOU TWICE, MY HUSBAND, YOUR BOSS, DIED LAST WEEK! WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING?&quot; \n&quot;Cause,&quot; he replied laughing, &quot;I just love hearing it...&quot; </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Police officers George and Mary, had been assigned to walk the beat. They had only been out a short while when Mary said, &quot;Damn, I was running late this morning after my workout and after I showered, I forgot to put on my panties! We have to go back to the station to get them.&quot; George replied, &quot;We don&#39;t have to go back, just give the K-9 unit, Fido, one sniff, and he will go fetch them for you.&quot; \nIt was a hot day and Mary didn&#39;t fell like heading back to the station, so she lifted her skirt for the dog.

Just as she was about to storm out of the house, her husband stopped her with these words: &quot;Before you leave, I want you to hear how this all came about. Driving home, I saw this young girl, looking poor and tired, I offered her a ride. She was hungry, so I brought her home and fed her some of the roast you had forgotten about in the refrigerator. Her shoes were worn out so I gave her a pair of your shoes you didn&#39;t wear because they were out of style. She was cold so I gave her that new birthday sweater you never wore even once because the color didn&#39;t suit you. Her slacks were worn out so I gave her a pair of yours that you don&#39;t fit into anymore. Then as she was about to leave the house, she paused and asked, &#39;Is there anything else that your wife doesn&#39;t use anymore?&#39; &quot;And so, here we are!&quot; </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>This little girl walks over to her grandmother and asks &quot;Granny, can you show me a magic trick?&quot; &quot;No dear, but I think your grand father knows one.&quot; So the little girl walks over to her grandpa and asks &quot;Grandpa, granny says you know some magic tricks, could you show me one?&quot; The grand father looks at her, &quot;Sure, just hop on my lap!&quot; So the little girl jumps on his lap. &quot;Now, can you feel a finger poking up your ass?&quot; asks the grandpa, &quot;Yeah&quot; replies the girl &quot;Well look, no hands!&quot; </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "On their first night together, a newlywed couple go to change. The new bride comes out of the bathroom showered and wearing a beautiful robe. The proud husband says, \"My dear, we are married now, you can open your robe.\" The beautiful young woman opens her robe, and he is astonished.\"Oh, oh, aaaahhh,\" he exclaims, \"My God you are so beautiful, let me take your picture. Puzzled she asks, \"My picture?\" He answers, \"Yes my dear, so I can carry your beauty next to my heart forever\". \n\nShe smiles and he takes her picture, and then he heads into the bathroom to shower. He comes out wearing his robe and the new wife asks, \"Why do you wear a robe? We are married now.\" At that the man opens his robe and she exclaims, \"oh, OH, OH MY, let me get a picture\". He beams and asks why and she answers, \"So I can get it enlarged!\" \n\n****************************** \n\nA woman was shaking out a rug on the balcony of her 17th floor condominium when a sudden gust of wind blew her over the railing. \"Damn, that was stupid,\" she thought as she fell. \"What a way to die.\" As she passed the 14th floor, a man standing at his railing caught her in his arms. While she looked at him in disbelieving gratitude, he asked, \"Do you suck?\" \"No!\" she shrieked, aghast. So, he dropped her. As she passed the 12th floor, another man reached out and caught her. \"Do you screw?\" he asked. \"Of course not!\" she exclaimed before she could stop herself. He dropped her, too. The poor woman prayed to God for one more chance. As luck would have it, she was caught a third time, by a man on the eighth floor. \"I suck! I screw!\" she screamed in panic. \"~censored~!\" he said, and dropped her. \n\n****************************** \n\nBefore the inauguration, George W. was invited to a 'get acquainted' tour of the White House. \nAfter drinking several glasses of iced tea, he asked President Clinton if he could use his personal bathroom. He was astonished to see that the President had a solid gold urinal! \nThat afternoon, George W. told his wife, Laura, about the urinal. \"Just think,\" he said, \"when I am President, I'll have my own personal gold urinal!\" \nLater, when Laura had lunch with Hillary at her tour of the White House, she told Hillary how impressed George had been with his discovery of the fact that, in the President's private bathroom, the President had a gold urinal. \nThat evening, Bill and Hillary were getting ready for bed. Hillary turned to Bill and said, \"Well, I found out who pissed in your saxophone.\" \n\n****************************** \n\nA man limps into a bar with a cane and alligator. The bartender stops him and says \"Hold on a second here - you can't bring that animal in here, they aren't allowed!\" So the man says, \"But my gator here does a really cool trick...\" \nThe bartender says \"Well then, lets see!\" So the man whips out his ~censored~ and shoves it in the gators mouth. He then takes his cane and starts bashing the gator in the head with it. A crowd gathers around and everyone is astonished when he pulls out his ~censored~ without a single scratch. \nHe looks around at the crowd and says, \"Does anyone else want to try?\" An old lady raises her hand and says...\"Sure, but don't hit me with that stick.\" \n\n****************************** \n\nA new guy in town walks into a bar and reads a sign that hangs over the bar... FREE BEER! FREE BEER FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN PASS THE TEST! So the guy asks the bartender what the test is. \nBartender replies \"Well, first you have to drink that whole gallon of pepper tequila, the WHOLE thing at once and you can't make a face while doing it. Second, there's a 'gator out back with a sore tooth...you have to remove it with your bare hands. Third, there's a woman up-stairs who's never had an orgasm. You gotta make things right for her.\" The guy says, \"Well, as much as I would love free beer, I won't do it. You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then get crazier from there. \nWell, as time goes on and the man drinks a few, he asks, \"Wherez zat teeqeelah?\" \nHe grabs the gallon of tequilla with both hands, and downs it with a big slurp and tears streaming down his face. Next, he staggers out back and soon all the people inside hear the most frightening roaring and thumping, then silence. The man staggers back into the bar, his shirt ripped and big scratches all over his body. \n\"Now\" he says \"Where's that woman with the sore tooth?\" \n\n****************************** \n\nA little guy gets on a plane and sits next to the window. \nA while later , a big , strong , mean-looking guy plops down in the seat next to him , and immediately falls asleep. \nThe little guy starts to feel a little airsick , but he's afraid to wake the big guy up so he can go to the bathroom. \nHe knows he can't climb over him , so he just sits there , looks at the big guy and tries to decide what to do. \nSuddenly , the plane hits an air pocket and an uncontrollable wave of nausea passes thru the little guy. \nHe can't hold it any longer and he pukes all over the big guy's chest. \nThen , the big guy wakes up , looks down and sees the vomit all over him. \n\"So,\" says the little guy , \"Are you feeling better now?\" \n\n****************************** \n\nA guy phones up his Boss, but gets the bosses' wife instead. \n\"I'm afraid he died last week.\" she explains. The next day the man calls again and asks for the boss. \"I told you\" the wife replies, \"he died last week.\" \nThe next day he calls again and once more asks to speak to his boss. By this time the wife is getting upset and shouts, \"I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU TWICE, MY HUSBAND, YOUR BOSS, DIED LAST WEEK! WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING?\" \n\"Cause,\" he replied laughing, \"I just love hearing it...\" \n\n****************************** \n\nPolice officers George and Mary, had been assigned to walk the beat. They had only been out a short while when Mary said, \"Damn, I was running late this morning after my workout and after I showered, I forgot to put on my panties! We have to go back to the station to get them.\" George replied, \"We don't have to go back, just give the K-9 unit, Fido, one sniff, and he will go fetch them for you.\" \nIt was a hot day and Mary didn't fell like heading back to the station, so she lifted her skirt for the dog. Fido's nose shoots between her legs, sniffing and snorting. After 10 seconds of sniffing, Fido's ears pick up, he sniffs the wind, and he is off in a flash towards the station house. Five minutes go by and no sign of Fido. Ten minutes pass, and the dog is nowhere to be seen.
