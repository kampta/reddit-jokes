While taking stock of the recently deceased, Gabriel says \"Alright, guys, Heaven's getting pretty crowded, and I can only let you in if I deem the story of your death worthy.\" The guys look at each other and nod and agree, all thinking that's fair. \nOne man steps forward and begins his story. \"So I thought my wife had been cheating on me for a while, and one day I came home early from work. We live in a high rise apartment, and as I was standing outside the door, I heard her giggling and making noises, and the faint voice of a man. When I got in there, she was surprised, and I said 'Where. Is. He.' She pretended like she didn't know what I was talking about. I picked up a wrench from the kitchen and began looking around, and you know what I found? A naked guy hanging from the balcony by his hands with only his boxers on. I start wailing on his fingers and he's yelling at me t stop and crying, and ultimately he falls. But the bastard lands in the bushes! Not a scratch on him! So I wheel the refrigerator over the rail and toss it over right onto him. Problem was, I pushed too hard and fell, too. And that's how I died.\" Gabriel stands there for a few seconds, and bursts out laughing, unbelieving of what he heard, and sputters out, \"That's great, you're in!\" And the first guy walks into Heaven.\nSecond guy steps up and starts, \"I live in a high rise apartment, and I'm a painter. One day I was feeling particularly lazy and decided to lounge and paint on the balcony in my bathrobe. As I was painting, I tipped the easel and dropped a bunch of materials. Thinking I could catch them, I quickly leaned over the rail. Well, I went too fast and fell right over. I was lucky enough to catch myself on the balcony of the apartment below me, but I lost my robe in the process. So I'm hanging, practically naked from this balcony, and calling inside for help, but nobody is responding. Then, all of a sudden, this guy comes out with a wrench and starts hammering my fingers! I fall, and luckily I land in some bushes. Thankful for my life, I tried to crawl out, but when I looked up, I saw a fridge falling! And that's how I died, got crushed by the friggin' fridge.\" Now Gabriel is dying from this story, tears in his eyes, he can't handle it. He coughs out, \"Dude, you're in. Thanks for that.\" He gets over it after a few minutes and wipes his eyes. He looks at the next guy, and says, \"Your story had better be as good as those guys' if you wanna get yourself in here.\"\nThe third guy steps forward and says, \"So I'm naked hiding in this fridge...\" ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "link_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "title": "This is a long joke, so bear with me.
