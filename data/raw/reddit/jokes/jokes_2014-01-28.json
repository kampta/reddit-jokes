Watching Jared&#39;s face fall, Steve quickly clarifies that he can still drop him off wherever he needs to go after he makes his delivery, if only Jared would ride in the back with the bowling balls.

About 2/3 of the way to his destination, driving up a hill, he passes another young black man, but this one is riding a bicycle. Steve can tell that he&#39;s struggling to pedal at the steep angle, so he pulls over and puts on his hazards. He invites the young black man into the back of the truck, just as he did with Jared. With the 3 of them and a bike semi-cozy, they begin to chat in the back of the truck.
