That is the most absurd thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Steve lets slip a wry smile and says, \u201cWell friend, I\u2019m a betting man. I bet JoJo can out golf you for the rest of the course, say 500 dollars?\u201d Frank can\u2019t believe his luck, sure that he can easily beat a gorilla at a game of golf. \u201cIt\u2019s a bet!\u201d And the two men shake on it.\n \u201cJoJo likes to go first, if that\u2019s ok with you friend?\u201d Asked Steve. Frank nodded. JoJo walks over to his bag of clubs, mangles around and eventually pulls out a putter. Frank starts chuckling to himself thinking he just made some easy money. \u201cHow long is this hole, about 500 yards?\u201d asked Steve. Frank nodded in agreement. JoJo pranced around his ball for a while, and started scratching his back with the putter. By now Frank was doing all he could to stop from laughing. JoJo finally focused on his ball, took the putter in his one meaty hand and smacked the ball as hard as he could, landing just next to the hole on the green. Frank\u2019s face turned white. \n\u201cTold you JoJo was good! 499 yard hit I\u2019d say.\u201d said Steve. Frank was shaking with nerves now. He stepped up and hit his ball less than a quarter way to the green.\n\u201cSeems JoJo got you nervous friend, tell you what. If you want you can give me 250 now and we will call the bet square.\u201d Frank knew he\u2019d never be able to hit as far as JoJo and gave Steve the money. \u201cCare to finish the game friend?\u201d Frank, already dejected about losing 250 dollars, figured at least he could say he played with the world\u2019s greatest golfer and agreed to finish. Frank managed to sink his ball in 5 more hits, one over par. JoJo stepped up to the green, determination written on his simian face, the slightest tap ready to sink the ball in the hole.
