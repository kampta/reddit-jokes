So one day Joe&#39;s boss goes up to him and says, &quot;Joe. I need you to go visit our client in the Himalayas, they want to put a face to their product and you are just the man for the job.&quot;\n&quot;The Himalayas? Wow, I would love to.&quot; He said.\nSo the next day Joe boards a plane to Nepal, and he arrives with a few days to spare. So he decides to go on a hike up the mountain, so he goes to this little shop to get some supplies and rent a pack mule. Little did he know that a storm was forming and would soon be upon him. He starts north ready for a beautiful hike in the Himalayan mountains. His first day goes off without a hitch, Joe makes it about 16 miles along the trail and sets up camp just off the main trail. The next day he wakes up to a brutal blizzard, it is impossible to see more than a few feet and the trail is mostly covered. He tries to make his way back but ends up getting off the trail unknowingly, heading deeper and deeper into uncharted territory. Finally he gives up and sets up camp again. The storm rages for 3 days, he missed his meeting, however that was the least of his concerns. When he finally emerges from his tent he realizes that he is completely lost. Most of his gear is gone and he doesn&#39;t know how he can make it back to town. Nevertheless he sets out, he hikes on for days with little hope of refuge. When all of a sudden he comes across a building, he immediately heads inside, to discover that it is a bakery, he asks the owner for a slice of his best pie and directions to town. The baker says his best pie is called Himalayan peach pie. Joe sits down and tries a bite, it is the most wonderfully marvelous slice of pie he had ever had in his life. He asks for a second slice, and a third, and even a fourth. When he left he took 4 pies with him. He found the town and managed to make his way home. When he got back to work he was fired for failing the client, when he explained the situation his boss felt sorry for him but could not do anything about his job. So he goes home. The situation he was in made him realize how good life is, so he calls his old girlfriend and asks to meet up with her for coffee. When she gets there he tells her about what happened to him and explains how he regrets breaking up with her. They end up dating for 9 months and after that, he proposes to her. She says yes, they have a magical wedding and for their honeymoon they decide to search for the little bakery that sells the magical pie. So they set out to Nepal, when they arrive they go to the same supply shop that Joe went to before and ask the man about the bakery. He had a general idea of where the shop was a circled the area on a map for them. They head out in search of the bakery. For 8 long days they searched, and had no success. On the 9th day Joe and his new wife are crossing a narrow snow-bridge when suddenly the bridge gives out and Joe&#39;s wife falls to her death. Horrified, Joe sets up camp and calls out to his wife hoping against hope that she was alive. He does this for 5 days, when he gives up he decides to just walk off into the distance until he cannot walk any further. He walks for 2 whole days and 1 night when all of a sudden he comes across the bakery. When he walks in there is a different man behind the counter. It turns out the man had a son who was now in charge of the bakery and had been dead for several months. He asks the mans son if he has the Himalayan peach pie, unfortunately the man never wrote the recipe out and no one knew how to make it. It was the last straw. Joe asks the man&#39;s son if he can search for the recipe and explains what he went through to get there.
