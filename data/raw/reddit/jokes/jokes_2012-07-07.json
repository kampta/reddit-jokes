The man can&#39;t get his money out fast enough. The bartender adds, &quot;But be careful, the genie is a little hard of hearing, and you can only have one wish, for life&quot;. &quot;No problem&quot;, says the man, my wish is simple. So he rubs the lamp, and &#39;POOF!&#39;, the genie appears, saying, &quot;How may I serve you master?&quot; &quot;I want a million bucks&quot;, says the man, in a very loud voice. &quot;Granted&quot;, says the genie, and disappears.
