It was full of underprivileged children who were taking their poor upbringings and cynical views on the world to school every morning. No staff wanted to be there, no pupil felt safe there. Bullying, drugs, it truly was a mess.</p>\n\n<p>However, sure enough, Mr Johnson began to work his magic. Within months the school&#39;s fortunes were turning around. Bad behaviour was dropping, students were learning to believe in themselves, staff were actually beginning to enjoy teaching these students who were becoming willing learners. Violence stopped, the drugs supply stopped, bullying stopped, students were actually happy.</p>\n\n<p>As time passed, the school began to churn out successful alumni. Lots went on to college thanks to the ambitions installed in them by one understanding, knowledgeable headmaster.

Mr Johnson. He had single-handily turned around the fortunes of three failing schools in his city with his tight intelligent financial control, understanding of the school's inherent needs and great relationships with all staff/pupils.\n\nRecently he had accepted a job at the most run down, violent yet biggest school in the area. It was full of underprivileged children who were taking their poor upbringings and cynical views on the world to school every morning. No staff wanted to be there, no pupil felt safe there. Bullying, drugs, it truly was a mess.\n\nHowever, sure enough, Mr Johnson began to work his magic. Within months the school's fortunes were turning around. Bad behaviour was dropping, students were learning to believe in themselves, staff were actually beginning to enjoy teaching these students who were becoming willing learners. Violence stopped, the drugs supply stopped, bullying stopped, students were actually happy.\n\nAs time passed, the school began to churn out successful alumni. Lots went on to college thanks to the ambitions installed in them by one understanding, knowledgeable headmaster. Students when asked about Mr Johnson would often describe him as a friend, but also an interesting teacher who they wanted to listen to every time he spoke. The schools facilities were upgraded to become state of the art thanks to Mr Johnson's financial control, and parents began fighting over getting their children accepted in to it when they were old enough to go rather then fighting to stop it!\n\nBut one day as Mr Johnson was strolling down the corridors exchanging pleasantries with students and staff he was accosted by a tearful young boy named little Timmy.
