why do you want to get ping pong balls when i can get you any electronic device from ANYWHERE in the world?????\" the boy just explained to his father that thats all he would want, and that the day would come when he explained to his father why he wanted all those ping pong balls. the father, beatened, just agreed and went to the store in order to get his son the ping pong balls. the next year the same offer and the same presents was asked for. ping pong balls. then, it was the boys senior year. his father drove him to school in the most expensive car that money could buy, equipped with the latest and greatest top of the line products. the boy and his father pulled up to the school. \"now listen son, this year is your last year of school, and for that i have the best offer for you, now ill buy you ANYTHING, a car, a boat, an island, mansions, women! anything you want! ill even get you your own private island! anything that money could buy!\". his son seeming excited agreed and bid his father goodbye. the end of the year came and the son graduated with top honors in his class. sitting in his fathers car after the graduation, his father asked him with the broadest smile what he wanted THIS time for his present. the boy thought long and hard and then responded. \"ping pong balls dad, ping pong balls\". the father couldnt believe his ears but knew that his son would not explain until he was ready. so they went to the store to buy his son some ping pong balls. that night the son attended a party but as he and his friends were driving home intoxicated they got into a bad car crash. the car went spinning out of control and all passengers were violently spewed out of the car. everyone was taken to the hospital and families were notified. later on that night the father sat next to his son's hospital bed. his son was covered with pulpy, splotched, torn skin, he suffered punctured lungs, and multiple fractures all throughout his body. the doctors were unsure exactly how he might recover. that same night however the son woke up and looked over at his fathers crying face. \"dad, im ready now, im ready to tell you why i wanted ping pong balls for all those years, im ready to tell you why i never played with them, and why you never ever saw them.\" his father sat up, \"yes son?\" his son looked him in the eyes, drew a breath to finally explain to his father why all these years he wanted nothing more than everyday ping pong balls. and then he died.
