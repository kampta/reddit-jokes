clucking and crowing and eventually the farmer goes back in to see the whole hutch of hens lying there in a post coital ecstasy. However the rooster is still gagging for some more! So he takes him across the way to an even larger hen house with close to 200 hens inside! He closes the door and again the same raucous screeching is heard untill he enters again to see all 200 hens in sheer bliss with the rooster stood atop then all triumphant but still unsatisfied! So the farmer takes him out into the back fields where there is an outdoor pen with 1000 free range hens in! He opens the gate, and respectfully lets the rooster in and shuts the gate, then, returns to his house for tea. When the farmer returns he sees all 1000 hens in a kind of sex coma BUT there is a small crumpled heap in the middle of the field.
