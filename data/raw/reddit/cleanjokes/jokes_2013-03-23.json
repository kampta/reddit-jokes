Now there is this level 0 cheerio. Hes homeless, living out on the street, probaly an alchoholic. But he falls in love with a frosted cheerio princess. So one day he sneaks into the royal gala and goes up to the princess and asks her &quot;will you marry me?&quot; Now she says &quot;I like your style, youre a good looking guy, a bit scruffy but I like you. Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio&quot; So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts. Now by having a job and his debts paid he becomes a level 1 cheerio. So he works, and he works, and he works, and he WORKS and he finally becomes a level 2 cheerio. Now he goes back to the princess and askes her again, &quot;will you marry me?&quot; she says &quot;no honey you really do have to become a frosted cheerio first.&quot; So he goes back and he works and works, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, I dont care. So he works and he works and he gets promoted at the restraunt and is making more money. And he works and he works and he works and by having that income raise he finally becomes a level 3 cheerio. He feels sucessful for the first time in his life but he is starting to fall back on his old ways. One day he goes to the casino and he loses and he loses and he loses and he gambled all his money away and he gets fired to boot because gambling is against company policy. So he is back down to a level 1 cheerio. He gets a job on a production line at a nearby factory and determines himself not to fall back ever again. So he works and he works and he works and he works and he WORKS, level 2, level 3, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio. But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio. So he goes to the princess and asks her again, &quot;will you marry me?&quot; and she says &quot;Yes I will marry you now.&quot; So a few months pass and theyre at the wedding recption, they allready said their vows and the party is winding down. The newlywed wife tells her husband &quot;Hey I&#39;m thirsty, can you go over to the bar and get me a Gin and Tonic or something?&quot; So the dutiful guy he is he went over to the bar and low and behold the bartender wasnt there. So he waits and he waits and he waits and he waits 15 minutes and the bartender still hadnt shown up so he decided he must have gone home since the party was winding down. So he went back to his wife and tells her the bartender wasnt there, can I get you something else? she replies: &quot;Ok, its fine. Here take this dollar and go buy me a Diet Coke at the vending machine in the lobby. So he goes to get it and theres a line for the machine. It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in lineonly to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda. So she tells him to get a cup off the table and get her some water from the cooler. So he goes over there and there is a line there too so he waits and he waits and he waits in line and the cooler runs out of water 5 people ahead of him. So exasperated he goes back to his wife and tells her, look there out of water is there any other source of liquid in this damn place. So she tells him &quot;screw it, just to go get some punch from the punch bowl.&quot; So he leaves, gets the punch, and comes back within a minute. She says &quot;wow, that was fast. What happened? How did you get it so fast?&quot; and he replies &quot;Well it was a short wait because there was no punchline.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "selftext": "Oh boy do i have a joke for you...  \nIts called the cheerio joke.  \n-------------------------------------  \nSo there is this land called cheerio land and in cheerio land there are 7 classes of cheerio, 0-5 and the frosted cheerios.
